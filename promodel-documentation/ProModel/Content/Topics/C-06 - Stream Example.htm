        <p class="p">The following example shows one reason why multiple streams are useful.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">Two copy machines, Copy1 and Copy2, are to go down approximately every four hours for servicing. To model this, the frequency or time between failures is defined by a normal distribution with a mean value of 240 minutes and a standard deviation of 15 minutes, N(240,15). (For more information on distributions, see <MadCap:xref class="lowercase_no_see" href="C-06 - User Defined Distributions.htm#C-06_1157716610_1086504" target="" title="" alt="">User Defined Distributions on page 1</MadCap:xref>.) The machines will go down for 10 minutes. Because no stream is specified in the normal distribution, a stream number is used to generate sample values for both machines. So if the next two numbers in stream number one result in sample values of 218.37 and 264.69, Copy1 will receive 218.37 and Copy2 will receive 264.69. Therefore, the two machines will go down at different times, Copy1 after almost four hours and Copy2 after somewhat more than four hours.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">Suppose, however, that the resource to service the machines must service them both at the same time.  The machines would have to go down at the same time.  Stream number one will not bring them down at the same time because stream number one sends the machine’s distributions two different numbers.  Using two streams (in the example below numbered ten and eleven) with the same initial seed will ensure that the machines receive the same random number every time.  The two streams have the same starting seed value so they will produce exactly the same sequence of random numbers.  The first number of stream ten will be exactly the same as the first number of stream eleven; the second numbers will be the same; indeed, every number will be the same.</p>

        <p class="p_10">Stream Notes: 1. 	If a stream value is not specified for a distribution, the stream is assumed to be stream one.  Stream #1 does not automatically reset after each replication.  2. 	The stream parameter is always the last parameter specified in a distribution unless a location parameter is also specified.
