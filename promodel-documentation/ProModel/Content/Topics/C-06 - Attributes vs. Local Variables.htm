        <h3><a name="C-06_1157716610_1085261"></a>Attributes vs. Local Variables</h3>
        <p class="p">Attributes are primarily useful where the value of the attribute is assigned in one logic section and evaluated in another logic section or field, perhaps at a different location. If, however, an attribute is assigned a value and evaluated within the same logic section (e.g., an operation logic), it would be more appropriate to use a local variable. Local variables act like temporary attributes and are valid only within the logic in which they are defined. See <MadCap:xref class="lowercase_no_see" href="C-06 - Variables.htm#C-06_1157716610_1085768" target="" title="" alt="">Variables on page 1</MadCap:xref> for more information. </p>
