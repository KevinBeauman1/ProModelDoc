            <MadCap:keyword term="Locations:downtimes:definition" />A downtime stops a location or resource from operating. A down resource or location no longer functions and is not available for use. Downtimes may represent scheduled interruptions such as shifts, breaks, or scheduled maintenance. Or, they may represent unscheduled, random interruptions such as equipment failures. Downtimes may also be given preemptive or non-preemptive priority and may require one or more resources for repair times.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">For single capacity locations, downtimes may be based on clock time, usage time, number of entities processed,a change in entity type, or called using the Down statement. Multi-capacity locations have only clock and called downtimes. If a downtime is occurring at a location and any other downtime starts (except a setup downtime), the two downtimes are processed together, not sequentially (i.e., downtimes overlap).</p>

            <li class="li_1_how_to_step">Select the desired location in the edit table.</li>
            <li class="li_1_how_to_step">Click on the DTs... button. This brings up the downtime selection menu shown here for single-capactiy locaitons. (Multi-capacity locations will only have the Clock and Called options.)</li>

        </ol>
        <p class="p_10">Please Note: An alternative and more straightforward method for defining downtimes due to breaks or shifts is to use the Shift Editor. The Shift Editor also has the advantage of allowing a downtime to be defined for an entire group of locations.</p>
