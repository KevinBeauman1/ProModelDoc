        <h4>Park Search Edit Table<MadCap:keyword term="Resources:park search:edit table;Park search:edit table" /></h4>
        <p class="p">Park searches are defined for dynamic resources through the Park Search edit table shown next. If several resources share the same path network, each resource must have its own park search defined (i.e., resources cannot share park searches).</p>

        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p"><span class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">Parking Node List</span> A list of <span class="_Override" style="font-style: italic;">nodes </span>to which a resource may be sent to park. The resource will look for available capacity at the first node in the list (Node capacity is defined in the Path Networks edit table in the Nodes window). If there is no capacity at that node, the resource will look to the second node in the list and so on until a node with capacity is found. If no capacity is found at any node in the list, the resource will remain where it is until capacity becomes available at one of the nodes in the list.</p>

Specifically, if a forklift makes a delivery and then becomes available at node N3, it will park at node N4. From node N4 it will park at node N1, and from node N6 it will park at node N7.</MadCap:conditionalText>
