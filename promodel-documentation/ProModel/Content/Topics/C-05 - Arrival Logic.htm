        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">Arrival Logic allows you to perform certain logic as an entity enters the system. It is used primarily for assigning initial entity attribute values. Suppose tellers at a bank drive-through process several types of transactions including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. A user-defined distribution, DT_Service, could be defined representing the probability of a customer requiring a give type of service. In the example below, 1&#160;=&#160;Deposit (60%), 2 = Withdrawal (30%), and 3 = Transfer (10%).</p>
