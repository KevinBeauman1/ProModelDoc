        <p class="p">For your convenience, predefined shift files are now included with your ProModel Corporation product. When installed they will appear in a Shift subfolder under the Calendar Editor installation folder (i.e. C:\Program Files(x86)\ProModel Corporation\Tools\Calendar Editor\Shifts\1p_3p_5.pmcal.)</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">These files have common nomenclature to simplify the process of identification and implementation of the proper shifts. Each shift file is named in the following fashion: ####x_####x_#(_###).pmcal. The first four numbers tell you what time the shift starts along with a letter to designate am or pm. The second four numbers specify what time the shift ends along with a letter designating am or pm. The third number specifies how many days of the week for which there is a shift definition. The numeral 1 means the shift occurs one day out of seven; seven means the shift is defined for every day of the week; a Monday through Friday schedule would be represented with the number five. The last value in brackets is only used when breaks are defined for the shift. The first of these three numbers indicates the number of breaks in a day, and the next two numbers indicate the cumulative minutes of those breaks.</p>
        <h5>Example   </h5>
        <p class="Syntax_body"><span class="Bold" style="font-weight: bold;">7a_330p_5_360.pmcal</span>
        </p>
        <p class="p">This file name represents a shift that starts at 7:00 a.m. and ends at 3:30 p.m., five days a week. There are three breaks defined, one for 15 minutes, one for 30 minutes, and another for 15 minutes. These breaks add up to a cumulative 60 minutes of break time, represented by 360.</p>
