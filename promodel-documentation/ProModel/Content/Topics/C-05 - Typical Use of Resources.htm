            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel,PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">The diagram below shows two types of resources: forklifts and an operator. Forklifts are used as resources to transport entities from Loc1 to any of the processing locations, Loc2 through Loc6. The forklifts are dynamic resources and travel along the path network, Net1, explained previously in <MadCap:xref class="lowercase_see" href="C-05 - Path Networks.htm#C-05_2723800551_1086257" target="" title="" alt="">Path Networks</MadCap:xref>. The operator inspects all parts at Loc7 and never moves from that location. Therefore, the operator is a static resource and does not need a path network.</MadCap:conditionalText>

        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">The diagram below shows the resource, wheelchairs. Wheelchairs pushed by LVN’s are used to transport patients from the Nursing Unit to any of the Or or X-ray locations. The Wheelchairs are dynamic resources and travel along the path network shown in the model layout. </p>
