        <ol>
            <li class="li_1">	Not every field of every module is included. Fields such as statistics, text in graphics, or yes/no fields which may not be edited cannot be searched for or replaced. To replace record identifiers, see number six. </li>
            <li class="li_1">Under “Modules to Search,” the Other option refers to information entered in places not listed in the dialog box, including the Simulation Options dialog box. </li>
            <li class="li_1">Notes fields are not part of the actual model data, therefore they are not automatically included in the search. Notes also include comments in the model. If you want to search or replace Notes fields, check the Search Notes option in the Find or Replace dialog boxes. </li>
            <li class="li_1">The Whole Words Only option interprets words loosely enough to distinguish words not separated by spaces. For example, searching for “Attr1” in the expression Attr1=Attr1+Attr2, would find both occurrences. You can search for expressions longer than a whole word, such as “Attr1=Attr1+Attr2,” as whole word expressions. To find a portion of a name, like “Attr” in “Attr1,” deselect the Whole Words Only option. </li>
            <li class="li_1">Once the Expression Search has found the first occurrence of an expression, a dialog box will appear giving information on exactly where the text was found. This includes a box displaying the entire line on which the text was found, with the search expression highlighted. In some cases the box may be too small to display the entire line. To see the hidden portion of the text, left click with the left mouse button on the text, and use the left and right arrow keys to scroll the text horizontally. </li>
            <li class="li_1">The Replace feature cannot be used to change an element identifier. To change all occurrences of a model element name (such as a location name), change the name of the element where it is defined and all other expressions containing the name, as well as any references to this record, will be changed automatically.</li>
