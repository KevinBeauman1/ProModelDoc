        <p class="p">An entity has two sets of dimensions, a logical (length and width) dimension, and a graphical (horizontal and vertical) dimension. An entity's length and width are used to determine the number of entities that can fit on a conveyor, and do not affect the size of the graphic on the screen during a simulation. They are changed in the fields labeled Length and Width in the Entity Graphics window. If multiple graphics are defined for an entity, each graphic can have a different length and width. Which side a user chooses to call the length or width is unimportant as long as the proper side is referenced when defining a conveyor. If no conveyors are defined in the model, no specifications of a length and width are necessary.</p>

        <p class="p">An entity's horizontal and vertical dimensions are used to determine the size of the graphic on the screen. These dimensions can be changed in two ways. The scroll bar to the right of the graphic will scale the graphic. In addition, the horizontal and vertical dimensions can be changed by clicking on the Edit button, then clicking on the Dimensions... button from the resulting dialog box. The default dimensions are determined when an icon is created to scale in the Graphic Editor. If the size is changed using the scroll bar, the change will be reflected in the dimensions listed. If you change either the horizontal or vertical dimension from the dialog box, the size of the icon will change accordingly.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="p_10">Please Note: Since the horizontal and vertical dimensions must remain proportional, only one of the dimensions needs to be changed. The other dimension changes automatically to maintain proportionality.</p>
