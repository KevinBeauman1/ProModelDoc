        <p class="p">Shifts and time off for activities and resources are defined using the Calendar Editor. Time off for holidays and vacation is defined in the Calendar tab by simply selecting the specific days to take off. A change in which shift an activity or resource is on can also be defined in the Calendar tab. The details of a shift, which include what hours of each day the shift runs and when breaks occur, can be defined in the Shifts tab. Shifts and breaks may start and end at any 5 minute interval of the day and are defined by selecting blocks on a grid divided into days and hours. Once a calendar schedule has been defined, it may be saved as a calendar file with a PMCAL extension so that it can be chosen for use by other activities and resources. </p>
        <h4>Calendar Editor Window</h4>
        <p class="p">The Calendar Editor window consists of a menu button, Quick Access toolbar, as well as the Calendar tab and Shifts tab, and the tab-specific toolbars. Clicking between the Calendar and Shifts tabs will display different views of functionality for defining your calendar schedule. Below is a screen shot of the Calendar Editor with the Calendar tab selected. </p>

The shifts also must have at least one or more days where work is not performed. Once one or more of these shifts have been assigned to days on the calendar, simply click the Show Non-Work Days check box in the upper right hand corner of the Calendar Editor. </p>
        <h4>Calendar Day Right Click Menu</h4>
        <p class="p"><span class="_Override" style="font-weight: bold;">Split Day		 										 </span>Launches the <span class="_Override" style="font-weight: bold;">Split Day</span> dialog, which allows you to select how the day’s schedule is divided between shifts or time off.

        <p class="p"><span class="_Override" style="font-weight: bold;">Erase		 										 </span>Same function as that of the Erase option in the toolbar. Selecting erase will delete the assigned shift or time off designated for that day and revert back to the base shift. </p>

        <h4>Shifts Tab </h4>
        <p class="p">The Shifts tab is located below the Quick Access toolbar and to the right of the Calendar tab. Select the Shifts tab to define the specific work and break time the activity or resource will be available on an hourly basis. A base shift must be defined and is the main shift that all other calendar items are exceptions to. </p>
        <h4>Shifts Tab Toolbar</h4>
        <p class="p"><span class="_Override" style="font-weight: bold;">Add Work		 										 </span>Select Add Work from the Shift toolbar to add hours worked to a shift.

        <p class="p"><span class="_Override" style="font-weight: bold;">Erase		 										 </span>Select Erase from the Shift toolbar and then click on any hour of blocked time to erase a shift decision. </p>

Other minimum time resolutions can also be used such as 15 minute, 30 minute, and hourly. These are set using the View resolution button. </p>
        <p class="p">The view resolution button is a drop down button that gives four choices for setting the minimum time resolution. When a time resolution is selected, the Calendar Editor grid will automatically adjust and only allow Work or Break time to be defined to that nearest resolution.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">For example, if the View resolution was set to 30 minutes, Work or Break time could only be drawn to the nearest 30 minute period.</p>
