        <p class="p">The last step in the simulation procedure is to make recommendations for improvement in the actual system based on the results of the simulated model. These recommendations should be supported and clearly presented so that an informed decision can be made. Documentation of the data used, the model(s) developed and the experiments performed should all be included as part of a final simulation report.</p>
        <p class="p">A simulation has failed if it produces evidence to support a particular change which is not implemented; especially if it is economically justified. The process of selling simulation results is largely a process of establishing the credibility of the model. It is not enough for the model to be valid, the client or management must also be <span class="_Override" style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">convinced</span> of its validity if it is to be used as an aid in decision making. Finally, the results must be presented in terms that are easy to understand and evaluate. Reducing the results to economic factors always produces a compelling case for making changes to a system.</p>
        <p class="p">In presenting results it is important to be sensitive to the way in which recommendations are made. It helps to find out whether recommendations are being sought or whether a simple summary of the results is wanted. It is generally wise to present alternative solutions and their implications for system performance without suggesting one alternative over another, particularly when personnel changes or cuts are involved. In fact, where there may be careers on the line, it is best to caution the decision maker that your simulation study looks only at the logistical aspects of the system and that it does not take into account the potential reactions or potential difficulties employees may have in accepting a particular solution.</p>
        <p class="p">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Animation:charts;Output:charts" />Animation and output charts have become an extremely useful aid in communicating the results of a simulation study. This usually requires that some touch-up work be done to create the right effect in visualizing the model being simulated. In preparing the results, it is often necessary to add a few touch-ups to the model (like a full dress-rehearsal) so the presentation effectively and convincingly presents the results of the simulation study. </p>
        <p class="p">After the presentation is finished and there is no further analysis to be conducted (the final presentation always seems to elicit further suggestions for trying this or that with the model), the model recommendations, if approved, are ready to be implemented. If the simulation has been adequately documented, it should provide a good functional specification for the implementation team.</p>
