        <h5>Chapter 3<br />Planning the Model</h5>
        <p class="p">Introduces you to the theory behind simulation modeling and gives an overview of model building procedure. This chapter outlines six steps to help you plan and create a successful, valid model. It then provides an example scenario, which designs a model from start to finish.</p>
        <h5>Chapter 4<br />Modeling Environment</h5>
        <p class="p">Familiarizes your with the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">MedModel</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">ServiceModel</MadCap:conditionalText> modeling environment.

        <h5>Chapter 5<br />Building the Model: general elements</h5>
        <p class="p">Brings you face to face with basic modeling components. Discussion revolves around the nuances of creating and working with locations, entities, path networks, resources, processing records, arrivals, shifts, costs, background graphics, and more.</p>
        <h5>Chapter 6<br />Building the Model: advanced elements</h5>
        <p class="p">Advanced elements ensure that the models you create reflect the exact behavior of your system. Contributing elements include attributes, variables, arrays, spreadsheets, macros, scenario parameters, subroutines, arrival cycles, table functions, user-defined distributions, external files, and streams.</p>
        <h5>Chapter 7<br />Building the Logic</h5>
        <p class="p">Applying intelligence and decision-making capabilities to your models makes them true to life. The logic builder helps you create and implement logic for operations, routings, shifts, breaks, and more. </p>
        <h5>Chapter 8<br />Using Auxiliary Tools</h5>
        <p class="p">Auxiliary tools allow you to work with many aspects of your model. You may create and modify graphics, search for expressions, or examine which statistical distributions best suit your modeling needs. </p>
        <h5>Chapter 9<br />Running the Model</h5>
        <p class="p">Running the model is the most exciting part of the modeling process. This chapter discusses the various conditions under which you may run a model and how to ensure that the model contains no logical errors.</p>
        <h5>Chapter 10<br />Reports and Graphs</h5>
        <p class="p">With the simulation complete, you are ready to examine the results from the model. Options available include reports, graphs, spreadsheets, and customized output templates.</p>
        <h5>Chapter 11<br />Language Elements and Expressions</h5>
        <p class="p">Describes the basics of the language used to define model objects and logic, as well as expressions and the role they play in creating models. Discussion focuses on names, reserved words, numbers, strings, operators, and basic syntactical structure, as well as operator precedence and numeric, Boolean, time, and string expressions.</p>
        <h5>Chapter 12<br />Routing Rules</h5>
        <p class="p">Provides syntax and examples for the rules you will use to route between locations in the model.</p>
        <h5>Chapter 13<br />Logic Elements</h5>
        <p class="p">Introduces the different types of functions and statements available to use in building logic for your model and identifies where you may use them.</p>
        <h5>Chapter 14<br />Statements and Functions</h5>
        <p class="p">Provides syntax and examples for the statements and functions you will use to apply intelligence and decision-making capabilities to your model.</p>
        <h5>Appendix </h5>
        <p class="p">Presents a categorized list of all expressions, statements, and functions with a table identifying which fields evaluate at translation and which evaluate continuously.</p>
        <h5>Glossary</h5>
        <p class="p">Contains definitions and descriptions for many of the terms and concepts common to simulation and modeling.</p>
        <h5>Bibliography</h5>
        <p class="p">Referenced materials and suggested readings.</p>
