        <p class="p" style="margin-top: 2pt;margin-bottom: 2pt;">Industrial vehicles include all push or powered carts and vehicles that generally have free movement. Utilize powered vehicles such as lift trucks for medium distance movement of batched parts in a container or pallet. For short moves, use manual or semi-powered carts. Single load transporters are capable of moving only one load at a time from one location to another. Such devices are fairly straightforward to model because they involve only a single resource and a single destination for each move.</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="Industrial vehicles:multiple load transporters;Multiple load transporters:see Industrial vehicles">
            </MadCap:keyword>Multiple load transporters, on the other hand, can move more than one load at a time from one or more sources to one or more destinations. Defining capacity and operation for multiple load transporters can be extremely difficult since there may be special rules defining when to retrieve additional loads and when to deliver the loads already on board.</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="Industrial vehicles:modeling" /><a name="C-06_1157716610_83445"></a>Modeling Industrial Vehicles</h4>
        <p class="p" style="margin-top: 2pt;margin-bottom: 2pt;">Modeling an industrial vehicle involves modeling a resource that moves along a path network. Paths are typically open aisles in which bi-directional movement is possible and passing is permitted. You may also need to define <MadCap:keyword term="Industrial vehicles:deployment strategies"></MadCap:keyword>deployment strategies (work searches, idle vehicle parking, etc.).</p>
        <p class="p" style="margin-top: 2pt;margin-bottom: 2pt;">Since people generally operate industrial vehicles, they take breaks and may be available only during certain shifts. So in addition to modeling the vehicle, you may need to model an operator that takes breaks and works on shifts or you may just want to assign shifts and breaks to the vehicle resource itself, in effect, modeling the vehicle and the operator as one resource.</p>
        <h4><a name="C-06_1157716610_92935"></a>Industrial Vehicle <MadCap:keyword term="Industrial vehicles:simulation benefits" />Simulation Benefits</h4>
        <p class="p" style="margin-top: 2pt;margin-bottom: 2pt;">Simulating your industrial vehicles will help you address design and operational issues, answering the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1">What is the required number of vehicles to handle the required activity?</li>
            <li class="li_1">What is the best deployment of vehicles to maximize utilization?</li>
            <li class="li_1">What is the best deployment of vehicles to minimize <MadCap:keyword term="Response time" />response time?</li>
