Output Viewer helps you make the most of the data collected during a simulation run by allowing you to analyze your data numerically, in spreadsheet format, or visually in a variety of charts and graphs. You can also perform Six Sigma analysis on your simulation data if you have a license of the Minitab application. SimRunner provides a way for you to perform an extensive analysis of possible solutions with your model through optimization.</p>
