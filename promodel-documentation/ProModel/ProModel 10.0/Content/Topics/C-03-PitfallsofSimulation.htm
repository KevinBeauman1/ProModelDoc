        <p class="p">If the steps that have been outlined are followed, the chances of performing a successful simulation project are very good. Typical reasons why simulation projects fail include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1">Failure to state clear objectives at the outset.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Failure to involve individuals affected by outcome.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Overrunning budget and time constraints.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Failure to document and get a consensus on input data.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Including more detail than is needed.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Including variables that have little or no impact on system behavior.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Failure to verify and validate the model.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Basing decisions on a single run observation.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Basing decisions on average statistics when the output is actually cyclical.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Being too technical and detailed in presenting the results to management.</li>
        </ul>
