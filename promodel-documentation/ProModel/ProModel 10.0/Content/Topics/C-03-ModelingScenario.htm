        <h3><a name="C-03_1917231497_1039569"></a>Modeling Scenario<MadCap:keyword term="Model:example of building a model" /></h3>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">Before we actually begin building a model, let's look at a fictitious scenario for our model building session.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">A local hospital has a small Urology Clinic that sees patients with appointments throughout the day.  The clinic consists of a physician, a nurse-clinician, a treatment room, doctor’s office, and several auxiliary areas.  Patients are greeted and registered by the nurse-clinician, wait for an escort to the treatment room, are treated by the physician and then have a short session with the physician in his office before departing.  Except on initial arrival, patients are generally escorted by either the nurse or the physician throughout their visit.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">You have been asked to model the care process to examine capacity and waiting time in anticipation of a forecasted 20% increase in demand for urological care. </p>
        <h4 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Model:elements" />Model Elements</h4>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">In building this model we must define all of the basic modeling elements and a few of the optional elements. </p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Locations" />Locations</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">As stated in the initial summary, locations to which patients may travel include the receptionist’s desk, the treatment room, and the doctor’s office.  However, as in all health care models, a waiting area must also be included at any point where patient queuing might take place.  In this case, such locations include both a line at the receptionist’s desk as well as a four-chair waiting room.  Note that the line at the receptionist’s desk is considered a multi-capacity location even though patients may not recognize it as having any physical or obvious characteristics.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Entity" />Entities (Patients)</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">Your study of patient conditions has shown that a difference in care times can be directly attributed to a patient’s condition as either acute or chronic.  For this, patients will be modeled as either acute or chronic according to a historical ratio and associated treatment time distributions.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Arrivals" />Arrivals</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">An examination of records reveals that a patient arrives every 45 minutes during an eight hour work day (8 <span class="_Override" style="font-variant: small-caps;">am</span> to 5<span class="_Override" style="font-variant: small-caps;"> pm</span>).</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Patient care process" />Patient Care Process</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">Patients proceed directly to the receptionist’s desk where registration with the nurse takes about 5 minutes with a standard deviation of one minute (i.e., N(5,1)).  Patients then proceed to the waiting area where they remain until escorted by the nurse to the treatment room.  Once in the treatment room, patients are further interviewed by the nurse for N(5,1) minutes and await the doctor. </p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">Examination/treatment by the doctor takes N(25,5) minutes if the patient is acute (60%) and N(30,5) if the patient is chronic (40%).</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">Once patients have been treated, they are escorted to the doctor’s office by the doctor where they discuss the examination for N(15,3) minutes.  Once the interview is finished, patients are free to depart and the doctor is free to see another patient.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Resources" />Resources</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">The doctor and nurse perform all activities of the clinic.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Path networks" />Path Networks</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">A single network called Clinic_net will provide a basis for movement for the physician and patients. However, because the nurse is both a static and a mobile resource, a second network called Nurse_net will be created for his or her movement.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Attributes" />Attributes</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">An attribute is simply a “numeric tag” attached to either an entity (entity attribute) or a location (location attribute). Since examination time for each patient is determined by the patient’s condition, we will attach an attribute called “Type” to each patient to determine his or her condition.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="User:distributions" />User Distributions</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">We will sample from a user-defined distribution and set the Type attribute to either 1 (for acute) or 2 (for chronic).  60% of the patients will be defined as acute and 40% will be defined as chronic.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">Before we actually begin building a model, let's look at a fictitious scenario for our model building session.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">Cogswell Cogs has just secured a contract to produce a new cog for production of the X-95C Family Space Cruiser. The current capacity of the Cogswell facility is not adequate to handle any additional work load while continuing to fill existing orders. Therefore, Mr. Cogswell has ordered the I.E. department to simulate the design of a new workcell dedicated to the production of the new cog.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">The process consists of loading a cast blank onto an NC mill for milling of the outside splines. Once the splines have been cut, the cog must be degreased, inspected and loaded with an inner bearing. All operations, including inspection, are to be performed by a single operator.</p>
        <h4 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Model:elements" />Model Elements</h4>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">In building this model we must define all of the basic modeling elements and a few of the optional elements. </p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Locations" />Locations</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">We need some type of receiving location to hold incoming entities. We also need processing locations where entities have value added to them. For the given production rate, Cogswell's engineers have determined that the workcell will require two NC_300 series numerically controlled mills, a degreasing machine, and an inspection/assembly station.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Entity" />Entities (Parts)</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">The entity types in this system include Pallets, each carrying six cast Blanks. Blanks become Cogs after processing, and Bearings are loaded at the Inspect station. If a Cog fails the inspection it will be called a Reject.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Arrivals" />Arrivals</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">Cogswell's engineers have determined that Pallets should arrive at the rate of 1 Pallet every 45 minutes.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Processing" />Processing</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">The operation at each mill requires an operator to load the Blank, which takes a normally distributed amount of time with a mean of 3 minutes and standard deviation of .2 minutes (i.e., N(3,.2)). After a blank has been loaded, the machining time is a constant 5.7 minutes.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">Cogs are then removed from the mill and placed in the degreasing machine. The degreasing machine has capacity for 2 Cogs, and has a cycle time of 5 minutes.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">Once the Cogs have been degreased, they are inspected for proper spline depth, and a bearing is installed in the center hole. This process requires the cell operator, and takes U(3.2,.3) minutes for the inspection and U(1.5,.2) minutes for the Bearing to be installed. If the Cog fails inspection, no Bearing is installed.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Resources" />Resources</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">A single operator, CellOp, performs all manual operations.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Path networks" />Path Networks</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">In order to make CellOp a mobile resource, we must define a path network. We'll call it CellNet.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Attributes" />Attributes</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">An attribute is simply a “numeric tag” attached to either an entity (entity attribute) or a location (location attribute). Since each Cog is inspected for proper spline depth, we attach an attribute called Test to each Cog, specifying the Pass/Fail status of the Cog.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="User:distributions" />User Distributions</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">We will sample from a user defined distribution and set the Test attribute to either 1 (for pass) or 0 (for fail). Ninety six percent of the Cogs pass inspection and have their Test attribute set to one. Four percent fail the inspection and have their Test attribute set to zero.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">Before we actually begin building a model, let's look at a fictitious scenario for our model building session.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">A local copy center has considered opening a satellite facility near the university campus. The new facility would specialize in short run, self-service, and operator-assisted orders.  You have been asked to model an initial design of the facility to determine if the proposed number of copy machines and the level of staffing will meet the expected demand.  Of particular interest is the use of all copy machines and the average time each customer spends waiting for service. </p>
        <h4 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Model:elements" />Model Elements</h4>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">In building this model we must define all of the basic modeling elements and a few of the optional elements. </p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Locations" />Locations</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">The locations in this model consist of all places where customers physically travel to and from to receive service.  This includes the entrance (InDoor), the self-service copy machines (SelfSrv1, SelfSrv2, and SelfSrv3), the order desk (OrderDesk), the cashier (Cashier), and the exit (OutDoor).  As in most service system models, a waiting area must also be included at any point where customer queuing might take place.  For this model, this includes a queue at the self-serve machines (SelfQue), a queue at the order desk (OrderQue), and a queue at the cashier (CashierQ).  Note that, in all cases, queues are defined as multi-capacity locations, even though customers may not recognize them as having any physical or obvious characteristics.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">In addition to queues and service locations, other locations must be created to process non-customer entities.  In this model, telephone calls arrive at a location called Telephone, and operator-assisted customer orders will be processed by two high-speed copy machines called OpAssist1 and OpAssist2.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Entity" />Entities (Customers)</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">Two types of customers are serviced by the center.  80% of the arriving customers use the self-service machines only.  The other 20% require operator assistance due to large or special orders.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Arrivals" />Arrivals</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">Customers arrive at an average rate of one every 1.5 minutes.  Past records indicate that interarrival times may be approximated by an exponential distribution.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Processing" />Processing</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">Customers arrive at the entrance and immediately go to one of two areas depending on the type of service required.  Self-serve customers go directly to a self-serve copier if one is available, or wait in line until a copier becomes available. Customers requiring operator assistance go to the order desk to place their orders.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">Since most of the self-serve customers need only a small number of copies, they pay for their copies using the coin receptacles at the machines.  Any self-serve customer making more than 20 copies will instead pay for their copies at the cashier. </p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Resources" />Resources</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">Two clerks, Clerk1 and Clerk2, are available to service customers according to the following division of labor.  Clerk1 is the primary cashier and is also responsible for answering the phone.  Clerk2 handles all operator-assisted orders and will also step in at the cash register whenever Clerk1 is on the telephone.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Path networks" />Path Networks</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">A single network called ClerkNet will provide a basis for movement for both clerks. All movement along the path segments will be specified in terms of time.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Attributes" />Attributes</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">An attribute is simply a “numeric tag” attached to either an entity (entity attribute) or a location (location attribute). Each customer arrives with a definite number of copies to be made. Therefore, an attribute called Quantity will be assigned to each customer representing the number of copies desired. A second attribute called Time_in_system will be assigned to each customer to record total service time.</p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="User:distributions" />User Distributions</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">In order to assign each customer a value representing the number of copies desired, we will sample from one of two user-defined distributions, SelfQty or AssistQty.  </p>
        <h5 MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Variables" />Variables</h5>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">On-screen variables will be used to show the number of copies to be made at each machine for each customer.  A second variable called Job_Number will be used to keep track of which job belongs to each customer at the order desk.  Finally, a variable called Total_Customers will track the total number of customers in the center.</p>
