        <p class="p">Doing simulation requires more than just knowing how to use a simulation product. A simulation study is, by its very nature, a project. Like any project, there are tasks to be completed and resources required to complete them. To be successful, a simulation project should be planned with an understanding of the requirements of each of the tasks involved. Many failures result from hastily jumping into a simulation without first taking time to consider the steps involved and developing a plan for proceeding.</p>
        <p class="p">Simulation modeling requires good analytical, statistical, communication, organizational, and engineering skills. The modeler must understand the system being investigated and be able to sort through complex cause-and-effect relationships that determine system performance. At least a basic foundation in statistics is needed to properly design experiments and correctly analyze and interpret input and output data. Ongoing communication with owners, stakeholders, and customers during a simulation study is also vital to ensure that a purposeful model is built and that everyone understands the objectives, assumptions, and results of the study.</p>
