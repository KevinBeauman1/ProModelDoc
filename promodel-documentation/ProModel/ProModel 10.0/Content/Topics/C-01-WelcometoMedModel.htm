        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">MedModel is a powerful Windows-based simulation tool for simulating and analyzing health care systems of all types and sizes. MedModel provides the perfect combination of ease-of-use and complete flexibility and power for modeling nearly any situation, and its realistic animation capabilities makes simulation come to life.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">MedModel provides engineers and managers the opportunity to test new ideas for system design or improvement before committing the time and resources necessary to build or alter the actual system. MedModel focuses on issues such as resource utilization, system capacity, and capability. By modeling the important elements of a health care system, you can experiment with different operating strategies and designs to achieve the best results.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">As a discrete event simulator, MedModel is intended primarily for modeling discrete patient care systems, although continuous processes can be modeled by converting bulk commodities into discrete units such as cc’s. In addition, MedModel is designed to model systems where system events occur mainly at definite points in time. Time resolution is controllable and ranges from .01 hours to .00001 seconds.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">Typical applications for using MedModel include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel" class="li_1"><span class="Helv_Bold"><MadCap:keyword term="Facility:planning" />Facility planning</span>

            </li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel" class="li_1"><span class="Helv_Bold"><MadCap:keyword term="Managed care analysis" />Managed care analysis</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">Use of MedModel requires only a brief orientation and virtually no programming skills. With MedModel's convenient modeling constructs and graphical user interface, model building is quick and easy. All you do is define how your particular system operates, mostly through patient movement, flow, and care plan logic. Automatic error and consistency checking help ensure each model is complete prior to simulation. During simulation, an animated representation of the system appears on the screen. After the simulation, performance measures such as resource utilization, productivity and inventory levels are tabulated and may be graphed for evaluation.</p>
