        <p class="p">A simulation project has distinct phases that must be understood and followed in order to be successful. Simulation requires careful planning with realistic goals and expectations. Steps to performing a simulation study include planning the study, defining the system, building the model, conducting experiments, analyzing the output, and presenting the results. Systematically following these steps will help avoid the pitfalls that frequently occur when conducting a simulation study. </p>
