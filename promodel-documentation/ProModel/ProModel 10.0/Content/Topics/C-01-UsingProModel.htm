        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel views a production system as an arrangement of processing locations, such as machines or work stations, through which parts (or entities) are processed according to some processing logic. A system may also include paths, such as aisle-ways for movement, as well as supporting resources, such as operators and material handling equipment used in the processing and movement of parts.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">The example below depicts a typical manufacturing workcell with six processing locations (Receiving, NC Lathe1, NC Lathe2, Degrease, Inspect, Rework), two entity types (Pallets and Blanks), two operators, and one transporting device (forklift). Models such as this are developed rapidly and easily using ProModel's graphical user interface and point-and-click approach to modeling.</p>
