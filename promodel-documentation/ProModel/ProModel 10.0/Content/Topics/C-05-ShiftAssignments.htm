        <p class="p">The Shift Assignment module allows you to model everyday, real-life situations involving scheduling and availability issues, and you can easily define logic to control the way your model handles these problems. <MadCap:keyword term="Shift:assignments:usage"></MadCap:keyword></p>
        <p class="p">If you have an employee that works a split shift, assign two shifts to the resource with the corresponding start times. If you have a processing location that can only be used during specifically scheduled hours, set up a separate shift for that location.</p>
        <p class="p">You may have an office or some other operation just starting up, and you need to run a specific shift for the first week and another for two more weeks before going to your full capacity shift schedule. Simply set up three shifts and assign them all to the office in one step, indicating the appropriate start times for each.</p>
        <p class="p">If you want to establish a controlled location gateway: Among fulfilling other duties, your employee needs to begin doing something (processing a certain entity at a certain location) at a certain time, so you set up a queue location, a gate location (with a capacity of one), and a processing location. Assign a shift to the gate location so it will come on line at the designated time. Now the gate location begins taking the entities from the queue location and moving them to the processing location, where the employee will be requested at the appropriate priority level.</p>
        <p class="p">There are many ways to use shift assignments and shift logic to solve any number of problems in creating a valid model. This chapter explores the features and functionality of the Shift Assignments module, including statements and functions for shift and break logic.</p>
