        <p class="p">The logic for a model can be constructed with valid statements and expressions within a logic window. Logic windows possess a number of features that facilitate the writing of logic, and one such feature is <i>Intellisense</i>. Intellisense is a feature that becomes active when you start to write a new line of logic within a logic window.</p>
        <p class="p">The Intellisense pop-up menu contains a list of all keywords and system functions, and of all previously established arrays, variables, macros, subroutines, attributes, entities, resources, and networks. When you begin a new line of logic, the list will appear and automatically scroll to the list elements that most closely match the alphabetical characters that you have typed. If a list element closely matches your entry, Intellisense will highlight that element. If the highlighted element is what you intended to type, you can merely press the ENTER key, and that element will automatically be entered into the logic statement at the current cursor location. Various model components (such as attributes, resources, variables, networks, or macros) are marked in the list with their conventional icons. Below are two examples of the Intellisense menu.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="p">Additionally, Intellisense properly formats the indentation of the logic within conditional logic statements such as the If-Then and While-Do statements, and it properly formats the placement of the starting brace ({) and ending brace (}) of such statements. The formatting of nested conditional logic statements is also handled by the Intellisense feature.</p>
