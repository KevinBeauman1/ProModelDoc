        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">MedModel views a health care system as an arrangement of locations, such as clinics or workstations, through which items (or entities) are managed according to some health care process logic. A system may also include paths, such as aisle-ways for movement, as well as supporting resources, such as doctors, nurses, technicians, administrative personnel and equipment used in the treatment and movement of patients and material.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">The example below depicts a Managed Care Clinic with ten locations (a waiting room, three examining rooms, lab, x-ray, three offices and a conference room), an entity type (patient), five types of resources (MD, NP, MA, Social Worker, and Dietician).  Models such as this are developed rapidly and easily using MedModel's graphical user interface and point-and-click approach to modeling.</p>
