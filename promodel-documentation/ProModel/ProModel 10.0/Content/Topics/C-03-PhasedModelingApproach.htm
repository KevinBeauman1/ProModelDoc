        <p class="p">Instead of trying to build a model all at once, you may want to implement a phased modeling approach where you build the model in stages. This will help you understand the basic modeling elements before moving on to more complex ones like attributes and If-Then logic. The following elements are those components normally entered during each phase of the model building process.</p>
        <h4>Phase 1: <MadCap:keyword term="Basic model elements;Model:elements:basic"></MadCap:keyword>Basic Model Elements</h4>
        <p class="p">In the first phase you input all of the basic model elements: General Information, Locations, Entities, Arrivals, and Processing. You also import a background graphic to help in placing the locations in the layout window. Upon completion of this phase you have a fully working model, ready to animate and collect output.</p>
        <h4>Phase 2: <MadCap:keyword term="Add:resources &amp; variability;Resources:variability: adding;Variability:resources:adding"></MadCap:keyword>Adding Resources &amp; Variability</h4>
        <p class="p">The second phase normally consists of expanding the model by adding resources and the corresponding path network needed to move entities, using resources, from location to location.</p>
        <h4>Phase 3: <MadCap:keyword term="Additional operations"></MadCap:keyword>Additional Operations</h4>
        <p class="p">The final phase usually consists of adding additional reality to the model—that is, adding those nuances that make the model an accurate representation of a real system. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1">Adding Quantity and Time_in_system attributes.  </li>
            <li class="li_1">Changing operational times from simple time constants to distributions.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Adding features that ensure accurate entity processing.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Adding variables for on-screen display.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Defining appropriate downtimes.</li>
        </ul>
