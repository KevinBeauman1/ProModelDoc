        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel is a powerful, Windows-based simulation tool for simulating and analyzing production systems of all types and sizes. ProModel provides the perfect combination of ease-of-use and complete flexibility and power for modeling nearly any situation, and its realistic animation capabilities makes simulation come to life.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel provides engineers and managers the opportunity to test new ideas for system design or improvement before committing the time and resources necessary to build or alter the actual system. ProModel focuses on issues such as resource utilization, production capacity, productivity, and inventory levels. By modeling the important elements of a production system such as resource utilization, system capacity, and production schedules, you can experiment with different operating strategies and designs to achieve the best results.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">As a discrete event simulator, ProModel is intended primarily for modeling discrete part manufacturing systems, although process industries can be modeled by converting bulk material into discrete units such as gallons or barrels. In addition, ProModel is designed to model systems where system events occur mainly at definite points in time. Time resolution is controllable and ranges from .01 hours to .00001 seconds.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">Typical applications for using ProModel include:</p>

        </ul>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">Use of ProModel requires only a brief orientation and virtually no programming skills. With ProModel's convenient modeling constructs and graphical user interface, model building is quick and easy. All you do is define how your particular system operates, mostly through part flow and operation logic. Automatic error and consistency checking help ensure that each model is complete prior to simulation. During simulation, an animated representation of the system appears on the screen. After the simulation, performance measures such as resource utilization, productivity and inventory levels are tabulated and may be graphed for evaluation</p>
