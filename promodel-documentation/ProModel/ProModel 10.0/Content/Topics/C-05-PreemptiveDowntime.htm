        <ul>
            <li class="li_1">If you preempt an entity’s resource, an additional cost per use will apply once you re-acquire the resource. While waiting for the resource to return, the entity does <span class="Emphasis">not</span> record operation or resource costs. </li>
            <li class="li_1">If an entity preempts another entity, the preempted entity continues to record operation time during the entire preemption period. While the preempting and preempted entities are simultaneously at a location, the location records the cost for both entities. If the preempting entity obtains a resource, the preempted entity will <span class="Emphasis">not</span> record the resource costs during the preemption period.</li>
            <li class="li_1">If an entity is at a location when a preemptive downtime occurs, the entity records the downtime as part of its operational costs. This applies to all types of location downtimes, including shifts. The location records the cost of the preempted entity while it remains at the location.</li>
            <li class="li_1">If an entity’s resource has a downtime which requires the use of another resource, the entity will <span class="Emphasis">not</span> record the second resource’s cost. However, the location <span class="Emphasis">will</span> record the extra resource’s cost.</li>
