        <p class="p">Each of the tools in the Graphic Tools button bar is discussed in this section, including the procedures for creating and editing a graphic’s components (called “objects”) using the drawing tools.</p>
        <h4>Graphic Editor Menus</h4>
        <p class="p">The Graphic Editor menu bar includes the following menus:</p>
        <p class="p"><span class="Bold"><MadCap:keyword term="Graphic editor:file menu"></MadCap:keyword><b>File</b></span>   The File menu allows you to open a graphics library for editing and saving a current library. It also allows you to print a single graphic or an entire library.</p>
        <p class="p"><span class="Bold"><MadCap:keyword term="Graphic editor:edit:menu"></MadCap:keyword><b>Edit</b></span><span class="Helv_Bold" style="font-family: Arial;line-height: 12pt;"> </span>  The Edit menu provides functions for selecting and duplicating one or more objects that comprise a library graphic. In addition, it provides functions to import and export graphics from other applications.</p>
        <p class="p"><span class="Bold"><MadCap:keyword term="Graphic editor:graphics menu"></MadCap:keyword><b>Graphics</b></span><span class="Helv_Bold" style="font-family: Arial;line-height: 12pt;"> </span>  The Graphics menu is for manipulating one or more objects that comprise a library graphic. With this menu, you can group several objects together, flip and rotate objects, and alter the color, fill pattern and line style of objects. You can also adjust the dimensions of the entire graphic.</p>
        <p class="p"><span class="Bold"><MadCap:keyword term="Graphic editor:options menu"></MadCap:keyword><b>Options</b></span>   The Options menu controls the editing environment. With this menu you can use a grid to help you align component objects, edit that grid, and require objects to snap to it. Finally, the Options menu allows you to zoom in and out on the graphic so you can edit the graphic at different sizes.</p>
        <p class="p"><span class="Bold"><MadCap:keyword term="Graphic editor:window menu" /><b>Window</b></span>   The Window menu allows you to arrange the windows (or iconized windows) currently displayed on the screen such that all windows are visible at once. It also allows you to bring any individual window to the forefront of the display. This is particularly useful when you are opening multiple graphic libraries and want to view all libraries simultaneously.</p>
