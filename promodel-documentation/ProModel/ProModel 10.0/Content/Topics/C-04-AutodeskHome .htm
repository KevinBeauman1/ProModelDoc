        <p class="p">The ProModel AutoCAD® Edition allows the user to build models within ProModel using Factory Assets and open the assets used in AutoCAD® Architecture or Mechanical 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 with the use of Autodesk's® Factory Design Utilities 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022.</p>
        <p class="p">ProModel AutoCAD® Edition also Provides a Plug in to AutoCAD® Architecture/Mechanical that allows you to give your AutoCAD&#160;drawing (DWG) ProModel Simulation Properties. This in turn allows the user to open the DWG in ProModel AutoCAD® Edition, where the model is scaled according to the DWG&#160;scale, locations, entities and processing added and the model can start to be simulated and added upon to provide greater detail and complexity. </p>
