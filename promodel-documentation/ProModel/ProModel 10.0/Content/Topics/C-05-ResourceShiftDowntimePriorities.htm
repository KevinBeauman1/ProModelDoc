The priority for a resource to start a shift downtime and the priority required for some other task to preempt the downtime must be set in the Shift Assignments module.</p>
        <p class="p">Although a resource may be in use during a shift downtime, the scheduled hours in the statistics will still reflect the hours scheduled to be on shift. For example, a resource goes off shift after eight hours. Due to an emergency, the resource is called back two hours later to work on a machine that has gone down. The statistics will still indicate that the scheduled hours for the resource are eight when the resource actually spent more than eight hours in use, because the resource was scheduled to work only eight hours. The resource's total usage time, however, will still indicate the additional time spent working on the downed machine.</p>
