        <p class="p">If there are multiple paths emanating from one node to another node, the <span class="_Override" style="font-weight: bold;">default</span> path selection will be based on the shortest distance for speed &amp; distance networks, and the least number of nodes for time based networks. These defaults can be overridden by explicitly mapping some destination nodes to specific branches that entities and resources will take when traveling out of a “from” node.</p>

If an Expression Array is used to specify the times for a time-based network and the time unit is included as part of the expression in the array, the time unit will not be used when determining the shortest path. In order to have the time unit affect the shortest path calculation it must be explicitly entered in the Time field (e.g. Arr1[1,2] min).</p>
        <p class="p">An example of mapping two branches of a network is given on the following pages.</p>
        <h4>Mapping Example<MadCap:keyword term="Path networks:mapping:example;Mapping:example" /></h4>
        <p class="p">The following example uses a path network diagram to demonstrate mapping.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">Suppose, as indicated in the following diagram, it’s important that a patient going to one of the three X-ray rooms (Nodes N5, N6 or N7) from the Nursing Unit (Node 1), not pass through the surgical corridor where ORs 1 and 2 are located. Since the distance from Node N2 to Node N3 and then to Node N5, N6 and N7 is shorter than going directly from Node N2 to Node N5 and then to Nodes N6 or N7, MedModel would automatically send the patient through Node N3 to reach the X-ray facilities because it’s the shortest available path.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">In this example, we wish to force resources and entities enroute from Loc1 to Loc4, Loc5, or Loc6 to take the branch directly connecting node N2 and node N5 to avoid traffic congestion at the intersection of the two main branches at node N3. Since there are multiple ways to go from N2 to N5, a decision as to which alternative will be used has to be made at N2.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">In addition, we want resources and entities to follow the same path in the opposite direction when enroute from Loc4, Loc5, or Loc6 to Loc1. In this case, the decision must be made at N5.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">Because the combined length of segments connecting N2 to N3 and N3 to N5 is shorter than the length of the single segment from N2 to N5, resources and entities based on speed and distance will normally take the former path to travel. To force them to take the longer path, we must specify mapping constraints.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">This case requires two explicit mapping constraints to override the selection of default paths in each direction: The first table entry forces entities and resources en-route from Loc1 to Loc4, Loc5, or Loc6 to override the default path and take the direct branch from N2 to N5. The second table entry forces entities and resources traveling from N5 (originally from Loc6, Loc5 or Loc4) to Loc1 to take the direct branch from N5 to N2. Entries 3 and 4 are <span class="_Override" style="font-style: italic;">optional</span>, and might be useful to speed up translation, since the restrictions they impose allow the shortest path calculations to be bypassed.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">To force the patient to take the longer path when going to and from the Nursing Unit and X-ray rooms, the desired path to be traveled must be “Mapped.”</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">The mapping for this example requires four lines in the Mappings table. Two for each direction at each node of the branch.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">When a patient traveling from the Nursing Unit to any of the other locations indicated arrives at Node N2, he or she must decide which branch to take. The first line in the Mappings table requires that patients leaving Node N2 on their way to Nodes N3 and N4 take the branch from Node N2 to Node N3. The second mapping specifies the alternative condition that whenever a patient is enroute from the Nursing Unit (Node N1) to any one of the three X-ray rooms, it must take the branch from Node N2 to Node N5.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">A patient returning from any of the X-ray rooms must decide which branch to take upon reaching Node N5. Line three in the Mappings table ensures that any time a patient is traveling to the Nursing Unit (Node N1) from one of the X-ray rooms (Nodes N5, N6, or N7), it must take the longer branch from N5 to N2. The final line specifies the alternative condition that patients enroute from an X-ray room (Nodes N5, N6, or N7) to an Or (Nodes N3 or N4), must take the branch from N5 to N3. Lines 3 and 4 are <span class="_Override" style="font-style: italic;">optional</span>, and might be useful to speed up translation, since the restrictions they impose allow the shortest path calculations to be bypassed.</p>

        <p class="p">There is a shortcut to force the same non-default path selection constraint to a number of destination nodes: For instance, if the vertical arm of the path network extended up to include many other nodes N8, N9, ..., and locations Loc7, Loc8, ..., then we would change the Mapping edit table as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="li_1_how_to_step">Delete line 1 in the Mapping edit table.</li>
            <li class="li_1_how_to_step">Make sure that line 3 is there (it is <span class="_Override" style="font-style: italic;">not </span>optional any more).</li>
            <li class="li_1_how_to_step">Include a line which reads: “From: N2, To: N5, Dest:&lt;BLANK&gt;”.</li>
