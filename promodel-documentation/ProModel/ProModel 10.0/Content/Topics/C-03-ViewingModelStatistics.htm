        <p class="p">The purpose of any simulation model is to gain a deeper understanding of the system under study. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">MedModel</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText>'s Output Viewer helps you to see the interactions between various system elements through tabular and graphical representation of system parameters such as resource utilization, throughput history, cycle time, and work-in-process levels. </p>
        <p class="p">After each simulation run, you are prompted to view the model output. You can select yes to view the results immediately, or select no to end the simulation and return to editing your model. Selecting yes opens Output Viewer and automatically loads the results of the model just simulated.</p>

        <p class="p">Output Viewer can be opened from within <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">MedModel</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText>, or as an independent application separate from <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">MedModel</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText>. You can load a single results file or several results files from different models for comparison of selected statistics. </p>
        <p class="p">Model output is written to several output files according to the type of data being collected. The main output file contains information of a summary nature such as overall location utilization and number of entries at each location. Other files keep track of information such as location contents over time and the duration of each entity at each location.</p>
        <p class="p">In order to see the power and flexibility of the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">MedModel</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText> output generator, see <MadCap:xref class="lowercase_no_see" href="C-10-ReportsandGraphs.htm#C-10_2322678712_1035124" target="" title="" alt="">Reports and Graphs on page 1</MadCap:xref> for a brief overview of the output generated by the Output Viewer.
