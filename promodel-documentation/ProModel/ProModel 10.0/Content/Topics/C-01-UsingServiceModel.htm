        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">ServiceModel views a service system as an arrangement of locations, such as queues or work stations, through which entities (customers, documents, phone calls) are processed according to some processing logic. A system may also include paths, such as aisle-ways for movement, and supporting resources, such as operators and material handling equipment used in the processing and movement of entities from one location to another.</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p" MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">The example below depicts a typical service system with several locations (SelfQue, SelfServe1-3, Cashier, etc.), two entity types (Self and Assist), and two operators (Clerk1 and Clerk2). Models such as this are developed rapidly and easily using ServiceModel's graphical user interface and point-and-click approach to modeling.</p>
