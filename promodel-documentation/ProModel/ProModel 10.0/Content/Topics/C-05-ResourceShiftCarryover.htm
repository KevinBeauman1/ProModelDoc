        <h3>Resource Shift Carryover</h3>
        <p class="p">When a resource is preempted to go off shift, rather than requiring the exact unit of that resource to return and complete the work, the entity will make a request for another unit of the resource to continue the work. This allows, for example, another unit assigned to a second shift to take over the work started by the resource on the first shift. &#160;In this case a shift carryover occurs for the entity utilizing a resource to perform a task. </p>
