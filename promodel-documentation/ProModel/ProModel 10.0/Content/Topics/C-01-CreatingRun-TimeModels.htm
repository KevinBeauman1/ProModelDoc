        <p class="p">One of the most powerful features in <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">MedModel</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">ServiceModel</MadCap:conditionalText> is the ability to create models that may be run by others who do not own the full software. ProModel allows you to install the software on any machine to run a model. However, without the security key, the user has limited ability to build or make changes to a model.</p>
        <p class="p">You may wish to develop run-time models to allow the user to perform "what-if" analyses with the models. ProModel encourages you to develop demonstration models, and allows you to distribute them freely. These models can be run by installing <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.MedModel">MedModel</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ServiceModel">ServiceModel</MadCap:conditionalText> onto a computer without a security key.</p>
