        <p class="p">Running a model is a fun and easy process. Models are compiled automatically at runtime, keeping you apart from any complex compilation process. If your model contains any errors, a detailed message explains the nature of the error and points to the module and line number where the error occurred. In most cases you are permitted to make changes on the fly.</p>

Concurrent animation has many advantages over post-simulation animation. By eliminating the two-step process of running the simulation and then animating it, you save valuable time. Concurrent animation immediately allows you to see if a model is working properly.</p>
