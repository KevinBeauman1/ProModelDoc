        <h1>Glossary</h1>
        <h4>C<a name="kanchor2282"></a>ost Statistics</h4>
        <p class="p">Statistics collected on a cost basis (e.g., total cost and average, non-use cost). You have control of how <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText> collects these statistics. You may collect information through statements, base them on the system clock, or use a combination of both.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2283"></a>Counter</h4>
        <p class="p">A counter is a location or variable graphic used to display the contents of a location or the current value of a variable during animation.  A counter consists of a frame, a specification of the digit color, and the font.  If the number being displayed requires more digits than the maximum specified, the counter simply expands to the left. <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText> displays real values showing only 2 decimal places. For example, a variable equal to 4.8936 would display 4.89 on the screen.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2284"></a>Dialog Box</h4>
        <p class="p">A dialog box is a pop-up window used to enter information or select options. Movement from field to field in a dialog box is accomplished by clicking in the field with the left mouse button or by using the Tab key. To accept input made to a dialog box press Enter or click on the OK button. To cancel any changes made to the dialog press Esc or click on the Cancel button. For help on the dialog, press F1 or click on the Help button. If no Help button is shown, you may select Help from the main menu. </p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2285"></a>Edit Tables</h4>
        <p class="p">An edit table is a powerful editing window used to add, delete and edit modeling and language elements such as entities or locations.  It is similar to a spread sheet editor in that it provides maximum visibility of element lists while still allowing each field of a particular element to be directly edited.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2286"></a>File Name</h4>
        <p class="p">A file name is any name used to identify a file. File names may include a path (e.g., C:\REPORTS\DATA) as well as a terminating period with up to three additional characters as an extension (e.g., DATA.TXT). File names are case insensitive.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2287"></a>Font</h4>
        <p class="p">A font is a collection of characters sharing the same attributes such as height, width, and typeface. A font determines the appearance of text. Select fonts using the font dialog which shows how the font will appear.   </p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2288"></a>Frame</h4>
        <p class="p">A frame is a graphical border or background for placing text or displaying values.  Frames have a type (raised, recessed, transparent), shape, color and size. Frames are optional and you may use them only to enhance the appearance of the graphic layout.  If you do not desire a  frame, select Transparent as the type.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2289"></a>Gauge</h4>
        <p class="p">A gauge is a graphic bar that extends and retracts to represent the current contents of a location.  You define a gauge by the fill color, the empty color, and the gauge border color.  You also specify the fill direction (up, down, left or right).</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2290"></a>Integer Number</h4>
        <p class="p">An integer number is a whole number ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.  Integer values may not include commas, so enter the number 5,380 as 5380.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2291"></a>Library Graphic</h4>
        <p class="p">A library graphic is a graphic defined and edited using the Library Graphics Editor.  Use library graphics to represent locations, resources or entities, or as part of the layout background with no association to any model entity.</p>
        <p class="p">When used to represent a processing location, library graphics may have entity spots defined for them so entities that enter the location will appear graphically on the entity spot.</p>
        <p class="p">You may reference a Library graphic multiple times and each reference may have a unique size, horizontal or vertical inversion, rotation, and color. </p>
        <h4>M<a name="kanchor2292"></a>ain Entity</h4>
        <p class="p">The original or input entity used in routing logic. You may create new entities from the main entity using the Create statement or through multiple routing blocks.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2293"></a>Main Menus</h4>
        <p class="p">The main menus are listed along the main menu bar at the top of the application window and provide access to all of the dialogs and commands necessary to build, run, and analyze simulation models. </p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2294"></a>Name Index</h4>
        <p class="p">During simulation run time, <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText> converts the name of each location, entity, and resource to a list index number for efficient access and flexibility in assigning names to variables, attributes, etc. The index number corresponds to the order in which the elements appear in the edit table list. If five locations were defined, they will be identified by the index numbers 1 through 5 at run time. A name index may be assigned to a variable or attribute by referencing the name itself (e.g., Attr1 = EntityA). You may also test for a name index by referencing the name (e.g., if Var5 = Loc3). </p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2295"></a>Note</h4>
        <p class="p">A note is any comment or other information typed by the user that is for information only and disregarded by <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2296"></a>Numeric Type</h4>
        <p class="p">A numeric type specifies whether a numeric expression is of type real or integer. If, for example, a variable is of type “real,” then the variable can only represent some real number.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2297"></a>Numeric Value</h4>
        <p class="p">A numeric value is any  real or integer number such as 3.68 or 52.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2298"></a>Parameter</h4>
        <p class="p">Parameters are variables used in a subroutine which are local to or have scope only within the subroutine. Arguments or numeric expressions passed to a subroutine are assigned to the parameters for use inside the subroutine.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2299"></a>Park Search</h4>
        <p class="p">A park search defines the sequence where a resource looks for nodes at which to park after completing a task assuming no other tasks are waiting.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2300"></a>Paths</h4>
        <p class="p">Paths define the course of travel for entities and resources between locations.  You may define a path for a specific entity and routing, or a network of paths shared by several resources and entities.  Define movement along a path in units of time, or speed and distance.   </p>
        <p class="p">Path networks consist of nodes connected by path segments.  Any node may have multiple input and output segments. </p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2301"></a>Positioning Spot</h4>
        <p class="p">An entity spot is simply a graphic position relative to a location or resource and displays any entities occupying the location or resource.  </p>
        <p class="p">For any given location you may place one or more entity spots on the graphics layout.  Entities to enter a location appear on the first available entity spot in the order they are placed.  If an entity enters a location and all the entity spots are filled, the entity will appear on the last entity spot.</p>
        <p class="p">For resources, place the entity spot where it appears when a resource carries the entity.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2302"></a>Preemption</h4>
        <p class="p">Preemption is the act of bumping or replacing an activity currently using a location with an activity of a higher preemptive priority. <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText> handles preempted activities differently depending on the location preempted.</p>
        <p class="p">For locations, <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText> puts the preempted activity (any current entity or downtime) in a preemption list for that particular location until it can resume its activity at that specific location unit.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2303"></a>Real Number</h4>
        <p class="p">A real number is a number ranging from 1.7 X 10&#160;-308 to 1.7 X 10&#160;+308.  Real values may not include commas, so enter the number 5,380.5 as 5380.5.</p>
        <p class="p">Examples:	-2.87563, 844.2, 65.0</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2304"></a>Reference</h4>
        <p class="p">A reference is a name entry in an edit field that references a defined model element.  If you change the name of the model element, all references to the element automatically change to reflect the change in name.  </p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2305"></a>Region</h4>
        <p class="p">A region is a rectangular area on the graphic layout that represents a location.  Defining a region is useful when you import a layout from a CAD drawing and you want to designate a portion of the layout to represent a particular processing location.  A region should have one or more entity spots associated with it in order to be meaningful.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2306"></a>Resource</h4>
        <p class="p">A resource is a person or item used to perform an operation or activity.  Common resources include human operators, inspectors, forklifts, and other vehicles.  Use resources used to perform operations on entities at a location, transport entities between locations, or perform activities on a location during a downtime.    </p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2307"></a>Resource Point</h4>
        <p class="p">A resource point is a screen position where a resource will appear when it arrives to park or perform a task at a particular node.  When a resource arrives at a node, it will appear on that node unless you define a resource point for that resource at that node.  Resource points provide a way to have several resources positioned at the same node without all appearing on top of each other.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2308"></a>Routing Priority</h4>
        <p class="p">A routing priority is the priority given to a routing for accessing a destination when capacity becomes available. <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText> defines the routing priority as part of the Destination field in the Routing Edit Table. A routing priority applies where two or more entities wait at a location for a routing destination to become available. The routing priority breaks a tie when deciding which entity has access to the destination location first when it becomes available. (See Selecting Incoming Entities in the Location Rules Dialog.)</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2309"></a>Scroll Arrow</h4>
        <p class="p">You can use the scroll arrows on either end of a scroll bar to move the contents of a window or list box.  Clicking once on a scroll arrow moves the contents one line.  Holding down a scroll arrow scrolls continuously.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2310"></a>Scroll Bar</h4>
        <p class="p">A scroll bar is a Windows control for scrolling the contents of a window.  Scroll bars operate in three different ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="li_1" value="1">Click on the scroll arrows at either end of the scroll bar for incremental scrolling.</li>
            <li class="li_1" value="2">Click on either side of the scroll box  for scrolling one window at a time.</li>
            <li class="li_1" value="3">Drag the scroll box with the mouse to scroll to a specific position. </li>
        </ol>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2311"></a>Scroll Box</h4>
        <p class="p">A scroll box is a small box in a scroll bar that shows the position of what is currently in the window or list box relative to the contents of the entire window.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2312"></a>S<a name="kanchor2313"></a>hell</h4>
        <p class="p">The temporary entity (representing grouped entities) to which <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText> assigns all costs and statistics until you ungroup the entities. Once ungrouped, <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText> divides all costs among the entities.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2314"></a>Status Lights</h4>
        <p class="p">A status light is a circle that lights up with different colors depending on the status of the location. You can place a status light anywhere relative to a location for showing the status or current state of the location. At run time, you can display a window showing what status each color represents.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2315"></a>String</h4>
        <p class="p">A string is a series of characters enclosed in double quotes (e.g., “Station A”). You may use strings to write text to a file or to display a message on the screen. </p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2316"></a>System Menu</h4>
        <p class="p">The system menu appears as a dash mark at the upper left corner of most windows. The main function of the system menu is to close the window. To do this, by either double-click on the menu button or click on the button once and select Close from the menu options that appear. ALT + &lt;space bar&gt; also pulls up the system menu.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2317"></a>Text</h4>
        <p class="p">Text refers to words that you wish to display on the graphic layout.  Each specification of text has an associated font, color, frame, and orientation (up, down, left or right).  You can rotate only true-type fonts.</p>
        <h4>T<a name="kanchor2318"></a>ime Statistics</h4>
        <p class="p">Statistics collected on a time basis (e.g., time in system, average minutes per entry, and average contents). You cannot control how <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText> collects these statistics since <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="PM-MM Conditionals.ProModel">ProModel</MadCap:conditionalText> bases them solely on the system clock.</p>
        <h4><a name="kanchor2319"></a>Work Search</h4>
        <p class="p">A work search defines the sequence in which a resource looks for work at locations where work may wait to be performed.</p>
