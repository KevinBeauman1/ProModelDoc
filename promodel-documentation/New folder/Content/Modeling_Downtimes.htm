        <h2>Modeling Downtimes</h2>
        <p class="p">An activity or resource may go down or be taken off line for a variety of reasons. When this happens it is no longer available for use. Downtimes may be interruptive or non-interruptive. If non-interruptive, the current activity is allowed to complete before the activity or resource goes down. Downtimes may represent scheduled interruptions such as shifts, breaks, or preventive maintenance. Or, they may represent unscheduled, random interruptions such as equipment failures that reduce the time that the activity or resource is actually available during its scheduled time of operation. They can also represent machine changeovers when going from one entity type to another.</p>
