        <h3>Changing an Entity's Name or its Graphical Representation</h3>
        <p class="p">After completing a particular activity, it may be desirable to change the name or graphical representation of the entity being processed.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p_10">Please note: The graphical representation for an entity is changed by changing the entity name and using the graphic associated with that entity. So whether changing an entity name or its graphic, a new entity and associated graphic must be defined.</p>
        <p class="p_10">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">The model used for this example, as well as all of the modeling "how-to" examples,  can be found in the ProModel Solutions Café (<a href="http://www.promodel.com/solutionscafe/howto/">http://www.promodel.com/solutionscafe/howto/)</a>.</p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <ol>
            <li class="li_1">Define an entity (i.e., drag a new entity shape on the layout) giving it the new desired name and graphic. This entity doesn’t need to be connected by an arrival or routing to any other model object.</li>
            <li class="li_1">In the routing dialog from the activity where the entity name or graphic is to change, select a New Name for the entity in the drop-down list. Note that the New Name option is only available in Percentage routings and Conditional routings.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p_10">Please note: If you want the entity statistics to be recorded by a name other than the current entity name, change the entity to the desired name when you route it to Exit.</p>
        <h5>Example</h5>
        <p class="p">Legs are assembled to a Table Top resulting in a completed Table going to the Shipping Area. You want to change the graphic after the assembly activity to appear as a Table.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="p">This is how the model appears during the simulation.</p>

            <img src="Resources/Images/changingentitynamesolution1.png" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 5in; }" />
        </p>
        <p class="p">In the routing Properties dialog going from Table Assembly to Shipping, the entity name has been changed to Table.</p>
