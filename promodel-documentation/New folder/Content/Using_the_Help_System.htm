        <h1>Using the Help System</h1>
        <MadCap:keyword term="help" />
        <p class="p">The Process Simulator Help System is designed to be a reference to guide 
 you through the process of building simulation models in Visio. While the Help System can be used as a step-by-step guide to model building 
 by following the table of contents order, it is much more functional 
 as a reference while you are building 
 a model.</p>
        <h2>Navigating the Help System</h2>
        <p class="p">The Help System is most easily navigated using the table of contents 
 along the left side of the help window. Sections are divided into topics. Additionally, the Help System can be navigated using the right and left 
 arrows in the table of contents to browse forward and backward through 
 the table of contents. The <b>Back</b> button located in the Help toolbar takes 
 you to the previous page you viewed, which may not always be the previous 
 page in the table of contents.</p>
        <h2>Advanced use of the Help System</h2>
        <p class="p">The quickest way to use the Help System is to select Help from the Process Simulator ribbon, which will launch the online Help System. You can then browse the <b>Table of Contents</b> or 
 enter a word or phrase in the <b>Search</b> field in order to find an answer 
 to any Process Simulator questions you may have.</p>
        <p class="p_14">If you are unable to find an answer to your question in this Help System, 
 please feel free to contact <a href="Technical_Support.htm" class="a_11">Technical Support</a>.</p>
