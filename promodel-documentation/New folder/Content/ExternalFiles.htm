        <p>External files provides you the ability to read and write data into and out of your model during simulation. This is accomplished with text files that are referenced in the External Files grid. For example, you could collect your own custom statistics using variables in your model logic and in termination logic write out their values to a CSV (i.e. text) file.</p>
        <p>To read data from or write out data to a text file, you must utilize the statements <a href="Read.htm" class="a_11">Read</a>, <a href="Write.htm" class="a_11">Write</a>, <a href="Writeline.htm" class="a_11">Writeline</a> or <a href="XWrite.htm" class="a_11">XWrite</a> in Logic.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The External Files grid has the following fields:</p>
        <p><b>Name</b> - the name by which the file will be referenced in Logic using <a href="Read.htm" class="a_11">Read</a>, <a href="Write.htm" class="a_11">Write</a>, <a href="Writeline.htm" class="a_11">Writeline</a> or <a href="XWrite.htm" class="a_11">XWrite</a> statements.</p>
        <p><b>Type</b> - whether the external file will be used in your model to read data in or write data out to the file.</p>
        <p><b>File</b> - the path and file name (or just the file name if it is in the same directory as your .vsdx file) to where the file is stored on your computer. You can manually enter the path and file name in this field or use the browse button to navigate to and select the file. The file must be a text-formatted file.</p>
