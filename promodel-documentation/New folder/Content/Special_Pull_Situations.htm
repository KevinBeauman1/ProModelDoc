        <h3>Special Pull Situations</h3>
        <p class="p">Sometimes the type of entity, its quantity, and timing for sending entities must be precisely controlled. This may occur where the pull or kanban signal depends on a unique situation that isn’t a matter of simply constraining buffer capacities or replenishing a buffer based on a drop in inventory. Perhaps it is based on conditions that change during the simulation. Whatever the case, situations arise where you need precise control over what entities get sent where and when.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">The model used for this example, as well as all of the modeling "how-to" examples,  can be found in the ProModel Solutions Café (<a href="http://www.promodel.com/solutionscafe/howto/">http://www.promodel.com/solutionscafe/howto/)</a>.</p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <ol>
            <li class="li_1">At the source activity where entities are being supplied, define a Send routing to where ever they might go next when the “pull” signal is given.</li>
            <li class="li_1">In the appropriate activity or routing where the signal is to be sent, open the Logic Builder and define the decision logic which activates a Send signal to the source activity indicating the type, quantity and activity to where the entities are to be sent.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Example</h5>
        <p class="p">In a make-to-order process the manufacture and subsequent assembly of a product doesn’t begin until an order is received. The facility makes two different products (A and B). Product A requires 1 component X and 2 component Y. Product B requires 1 component Y and has 2 component Z. The component parts wait in their respective inventories until an order is received.</p>

        <p class="p">The solution to this and similar situations is easily handled using the SEND routing in conjunction with the SEND statement defined in one or more Logic Builders.</p>
