        <h3>Entity Creating Activities</h3>
        <p class="p">One or more new entities are created as a result of an entity activity. The modeler can decide whether the incoming entity is to persist or disappear after the new entities are created.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">The model used for this example, as well as all of the modeling "how-to" examples,  can be found in the ProModel Solutions Café (<a href="http://www.promodel.com/solutionscafe/howto/">http://www.promodel.com/solutionscafe/howto/)</a>. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9899MN3Agvc&amp;list=UUjdNEjUGmpb-U5ifC2eBJEg&amp;index=20&amp;feature=plcp" target="_blank">A video demonstrating this solution can be found here.</a></p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <ol>
            <li class="li_1">Make sure an entity is defined for the entity to be created.</li>
            <li class="li_1">In the activity dialog where the new entities are to be created, enter the time required, if any, for the creation of the entities in the Activity Time field.</li>
            <li class="li_1">For each new entity type being created, define a Create routing leading to some activity where the newly created entities are to be placed or sent.</li>
            <li class="li_1">In each Create routing dialog, select After Activity if the creation of the new entities is to occur after the defined activity time (most typical option).</li>
            <li class="li_1">In each Create routing dialog, enter the name and quantity of entities to be created.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Define a routing other than a Create routing, which will apply to the original incoming entity. If the incoming entity is to terminate once the new entities are created, no additional routing should be defined.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Example</h5>
        <p class="p">Incoming shipments arrive in containerized cartons with 100 cartons to a container. At an unload activity the cartons are removed (“created”) from the container and stored. The empty containers are then routed to shipping to go back to the supplier.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="p">A Create routing is defined from Unload to Storage for 100 containers. The container itself is routed on to Shipping.</p>
