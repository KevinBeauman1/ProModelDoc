        <h1>Defining Logic</h1>
        <MadCap:keyword term="logic:defining" />
        <p>Process Simulator logic controls the flow of entities through your process and
 defines what happens to them along the way. For information and theory on
 controlling this flow of entities, see <MadCap:xref href="FlowControl.htm" style="text-decoration: none;">Flow Control</MadCap:xref>. Data entered in shape property fields is, in its basic form, a simple form of logic.
 More controlled or custom logic is defined in Logic windows.</p>
        <h2>Through Shape Properties</h2>
        <MadCap:keyword term="logic:defining" />
        <p>All the data necessary to model a high-level view of a process can be entered
 through the shape property fields of the objects in your layout. Right-clicking
 on an object and selecting Properties from the menu will display shape properties
 for that object.</p>
        <p>From the shape properties fields, you can define such items as process times, resource
 usage, routing decisions, arrival patterns, and other high-level logic. For
 more information on the details available in shape properties,
 please see <MadCap:xref href="DefiningAProcess.htm">Defining a Process</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Through Logic Windows</h2>
        <p>Logic allows you to add more detail to your process by including
 deeper decision-making, tracking, and control. <a href="Intellisense.htm" class="a_11">Intellisense</a> and the <a href="SyntaxGuide.htm" class="a_11">Syntax Guide</a> assist you in writing correct custom logic. During simulation, the Trace and Debug features help you validate your logic.</p>
        <p>This logic is defined within Logic windows found in shape properties for activities, resources, arrivals, and routes, as well as subroutines and Initialization and Termination logic.</p>
