        <h2>Other Objects</h2>
        <p class="p">ProModel also provides a few other objects that will enable you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1"> Access the data found in the classic output statistics files (*.rdb, *.rdt).</li>
            <li class="li_1">Capture and respond to events that take place in ProModel
There are two files that allow you to work with the classic output statistics. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">They are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1">Rdbsvr.dll – This DLL gives you access to the General Statistics data.
</li>
            <li class="li_1">Rdtdata.dll – This DLL gives you access to the Time Series data.
</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">The “ProModel Events 8.0 Type Library” (pmcp80.dll) gives you a way to respond to things that happen
(events) in ProModel. With it, you can:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1">Trap and respond to errors without user intervention</li>
            <li class="li_1">Hide informational messages</li>
            <li class="li_1">Get information about changes the user makes during simulation, such as changing the animation
speed or the view.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Handle ProModel “Prompt” dialogs or replace them with your own dialogs</li>
        </ul>
