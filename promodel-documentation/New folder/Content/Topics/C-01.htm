        <h2>ProModel’s ActiveX Components</h2>
        <p class="p">ProModel’s ActiveX Automation capability allows you to use any ActiveX-enabled language (e.g. Microsoft Visual Basic, VBA, Visual C#, or Visual C++) to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1">Build customized user interfaces for ProModel</li>
            <li class="li_1">Add, Change or Delete model data from external data sources, such as spreadsheets, databases or ASCII text files</li>
            <li class="li_1">Control ProModel from another application</li>
            <li class="li_1">Extract output data and place it in a spreadsheet or database</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">The intent of this manual is to give you information that is specific to the ActiveX components automatically installed with your PROMODEL product.  We have included plenty of examples to help you understand how to use these powerful tools.  All of the examples that follow use Visual Basic commands and syntax.  The variable names used in this manual are merely examples, you will want to replace them with names that are meaningful to you.</p>
