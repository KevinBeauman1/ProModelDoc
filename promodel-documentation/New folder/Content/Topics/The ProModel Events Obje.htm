            <br />The ProModel Events Object</h1>
        <p class="p">The PMEvents object is found in the <span class="_Override" style="font-style: italic;">ProModel Events 8.0 Type Library</span>. This object provides methods for trapping and responding to certain events that happen in ProModel.  The PMEvents object must be initialized by the GetEventsObject method found in the ProModel Application object. In Visual Basic, you must declare this object variable using the WithEvents keyword.  When this is done, Visual Basic will automatically create a new entry in the Object drop-down list box in the module where the object variable was declared (you do not need to manually declare the Event Handler function). Within the Event Handler function, you will place code to respond to events returned by ProModel to your application. You may modify the default behavior of some events by returning ‘True’ from your Event Handler method.</p>
