        <h3>Tracking Resource Activity Time Cost</h3>
        <p class="p">Increase the unit cost of an entity according to the length of time a resource was used or activity performed.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">The model used for this example, as well as all of the modeling "how-to" examples,  can be found in the ProModel Solutions Café (<a href="http://www.promodel.com/solutionscafe/howto/">http://www.promodel.com/solutionscafe/howto/)</a>.</p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <ol>
            <li class="li_1">Open the resource or activity dialog.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Enter an hourly cost to be applied.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Each time during the simulation when this resource or activity is used, the hourly rate is used to determine the incremental cost to be added to the entity.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Example</h5>
        <p class="p">A coordinate measuring machine (CMM) is used on certain parts and is charged out at $150.00 an hour. We want to add this cost to the entities that use it.</p>

        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/trackingresourcestimecostsolution1.png" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 5in; }" />
        </p>
        <p class="p">The hourly rate for the CMM is set to $150. Alternatively, we could have defined the CMM as an activity and set the hourly rate for the activity to $150.</p>
