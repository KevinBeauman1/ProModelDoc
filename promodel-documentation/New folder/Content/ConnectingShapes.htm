        <h1>Connecting Shapes</h1>
        <MadCap:keyword term="shapes;connecting shapes" />
        <p class="p">After placing the shapes on the layout, they should be connected to define the processing sequence or routing. To connect shapes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="li_1">Click on the <b>Connector</b> tool, which puts you in connection mode. </li>
            <li class="li_1">Move the cursor over either the middle of the <b>FROM</b> shape or one of the four sides of the shape until a green highlight appears.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Click on the <b>FROM</b> shape, hold the left mouse button and drag to the <b>TO</b> shape until a similar green highlight appears.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Release the button.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The connection is complete if both the beginning and ending points of the selected connection are highlighted in green. If either end is not green, click and drag the unconnected end to either the middle or sides of the shape until you see a green highlight and then release the button.</p>
        <p>Each entity can be connected to one or more activities where it arrives into the system and begins processing. Each activity should be connected to one or more activities showing the process sequence. Connecting an entity to an activity defines an arrival of the entity to that activity.</p>
        <p>Resources are the only shapes that do not need to be connected to other shapes. If you are making the final connection or ending the process see <MadCap:xref href="Terminating_a_Process.htm" target="" title="" alt="" class="text_page_in_parenthesis">Terminating a Process</MadCap:xref>. Also, you may use the <MadCap:xref href="AutomaticShapeConnection.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Automatic Shape Connection</MadCap:xref> feature of Process Simulator to more quickly connect your shapes in the diagram.</p>
        <p>If a connection is invalid for any reason, an “(Error)” label will appear on the connection. To identify the reason for the error, simply move the cursor over the “(Error)” label and a pop-up window will appear with an explanation for the error. Once the appropriate correction is made the “(Error)” label will disappear.</p>
        <p class="p_10">Please note: Connections can be made with straight lines or curved lines.</p>
