            <MadCap:keyword term="object explorer" />Object Explorer</h1>
        <p>The Object Explorer displays a tree view of all the objects 
 in your model. This is helpful for understanding how the shapes and connections 
 in your model interact. The Object Explorer is also useful for reordering. &#160;This 
 is done by selecting&#160;one of the items in the list and dragging it to the new position. The 
 connections between activities may be moved to determine the order that 
 entities will route from one activity to several available activities.</p>
        <p>For example, if you have entities routing from multiple activities to 
 an activity using the <MadCap:xref href="Attach.htm" target="" title="" alt="" class="text_page_in_parenthesis">Attach</MadCap:xref> routing type, the 
 order in which the destination activities are chosen for routing is determined 
 by the order of the listed attach routings in the Object Explorer.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong class="strong_1">Object Filter</strong>&#160;&#160;This drop down list gives options to view the simulation objects for the Main Model (all pages marked as type Main) or each individual page within your document. If a page is marked as type Submodel or Plain, this will be designated within parentheses next to the page name in the list.</li>
            <li><strong class="strong_1">Refresh</strong>&#160;&#160;The Refresh button allows you to reload the list of objects, which you will need to do if you make changes to your diagram and want to see those changes reflected in the Object Explorer. In other words, the Object Explorer does not automatically update whenever changes are made (e.g. adding, renaming or removing an activity). You must manually update the Object Explorer by clicking the Refresh button.</li>
            <li><strong class="strong_1">Collapse All</strong>&#160;&#160;This button will collapse all expanded folders down to the root elements (as can be seen above).</li>
            <li><strong class="strong_1">View Object</strong>&#160;&#160;With this button toggled on, as you select a shape in Object Explorer, the layout in Visio will be panned to bring that shape into view. If the shape is on a page other than the active one, its page will be activated and the shape will be brought into view.</li>
            <li><strong class="strong_1">Show Index Number</strong>&#160;&#160;With this button toggled on, as you select a shape in Object Explorer, the layout in Visio will be panned to bring that shape into view. If the shape is on a page other than the active one, its page will be activated and the shape will be brought into view.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p_10">Note: the ability to show or hide index numbers is a feature available only in the Professional edition of Process Simulator. Index numbers are needed in referencing activities, entities, and resources in array cell definition or in statements through system functions like Loc(), Ent() and Res().</p>
