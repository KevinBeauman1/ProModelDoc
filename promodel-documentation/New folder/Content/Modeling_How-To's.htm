        <h1>Modeling How-To's</h1>
        <p>Learning how to use Process Simulator requires more than just becoming familiar with the product features and menus. It also requires an understanding of how to correctly use these features and menus to create representative models of actual business processes. Beginners to simulation quickly learn that even the simplest processes often have characteristics that may be tricky to model. The modeling how-to’s described here are intended to help you learn the techniques needed to model most situations you are likely to encounter when doing a simulation study. As will become apparent, there are often multiple ways to model a process, so the techniques shown here don’t necessarily represent the only way to model a given situation.</p>
        <p>These Modeling how-to’s assume that you are familiar with the basic concepts of simulation and that you have reviewed the Process Simulator help system or gone through training. At a minimum, you should be familiar with the different types of shapes and connections used in Process Simulator and how to construct a process flow diagram. You also need to know that by right clicking on a shape or connector and selecting Properties… you open its Shape Properties window for defining its properties and behavior.</p>
        <p>The models for all of the modeling examples  can be found in the ProModel Solutions Café (<a href="http://www.promodel.com/solutionscafe/howto/" class="a_11">http://www.promodel.com/solutionscafe/howto/)</a>.</p>
