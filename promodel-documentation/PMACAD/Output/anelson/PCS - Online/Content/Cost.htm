        <h1>Cost Calculations</h1>
        <p>Process Simulator allows you to collect cost data on entities, activities 
 and resources. The unit cost for each entity processed is shown in the 
 scoreboard in the output report. Total costs by activity, resource and 
 entity can also be viewed in the output report. </p>
        <p>To define a process with costing, you can enter costing information 
 to the objects in your process through the properties dialogs for each 
 object. In the following situations, specific costing rules apply:</p>
        <h2>Interrupt/Off Shift</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1" value="1">If you interrupt an entity’s resource, an additional 
 cost per use will apply once you re-acquire the resource. While waiting 
 for the resource to return, the entity does not record operation or resource 
 costs. </li>
            <li class="li_1" value="2">If an entity interrupts another entity, the interrupted 
 entity continues to record operation time during the entire interruption 
 period. While the interrupting and interrupted entities are simultaneously 
 at an activity, the activity records the cost for both entities. If the 
 interrupting entity obtains a resource, the interrupted entity will not 
 record the resource costs during the interruption period.</li>
            <li class="li_1" value="3">If an entity is at an activity and is interrupted 
 when the activity goes off shift, the entity records the time off shift 
 as part of its operational costs. The activity records the cost of the 
 interrupted entity while it remains at the activity.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Attach</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1" value="1">Attached entities do not add their costs or time 
 statistics to their base entities.</li>
            <li class="li_1" value="2">When a Detach occurs, Process Simulator divides all 
 costs accrued by an attached entity among the detached entities. Process 
 Simulator adds all other entity statistics calculated during the attached 
 period to each of the detached entities.</li>
            <li class="li_1" value="3">Entities leaving the system that are attached onto 
 other entities do NOT report their individual costs, but do report all 
 other statistics. To get the cost of each entity, you must detach the 
 entities before they exit.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Batch</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1" value="1">Batched entities do not add their costs or statistics 
 to the batch shell (a temporary entity representing batched entities that 
 starts with cost and time statistics of zero).</li>
            <li class="li_1" value="2">When an unbatch occurs, Process Simulator divides 
 all costs accrued by a batched entity among the unbatched entities. Process 
 Simulator copies all other entity statistics calculated during the batched 
 period to each of the unbatched entities.</li>
            <li class="li_1" value="3">When an unbatch occurs, the first entity processed from the batch takes any resources the batch owns.</li>
            <li class="li_1" value="4">When an unbatch occurs, attributes that were assigned to the batch are not passed to any unbatched entity.</li>
            <li class="li_1" value="5">Entities leaving the system batched with other entities 
 do NOT report their individual costs, but do report all other statistics. 
 To get the cost of each entity, you must unbatch the entities before they 
 exit.</li>
            <li class="li_1" value="6">If a batch has members that are also batched, only the top level batch is unbatched with an UNBATCH function. Subsequent unbatching will continue to occur in a first-in-last-out (FILO) sequence until all batches have been unbatched in reverse order with respect to how the batches were created originally.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Special Cost Handling</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1" value="1">As soon as you acquire a resource, it begins to accrue 
 cost.</li>
            <li class="li_1" value="2">If an activity uses a resource during an off shift 
 period, the activity accrues that resource’s cost.</li>
            <li class="li_1" value="3">The USE statement counts as operation and resource 
 cost.</li>
            <li class="li_1" value="4">When you Create a new entity, it begins with new 
 time statistics and an initial cost.</li>
            <li class="li_1" value="5">If you Rename an entity, previous time statistics 
 and costs continue with the entity.</li>
        </ul>
