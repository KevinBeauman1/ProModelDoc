        <p>Once you have defined a process and built a model, you are ready to begin making important decisions based upon the resulting simulation data. To help you make the most of the data collected during your simulation, Process Simulator comes with a powerful easy to use Output Viewer. The Output Viewer allows you to view your data numerically in spreadsheet format or graphically in a variety of charts. </p>
        <p>To view results in Output Viewer, click the <b>Output Viewer</b> button in the Process Simulator ribbon or click Yes to view results at the end of the simulation run.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="p_10">Please note: If a simulation or scenarios have previously run, Output Viewer will automatically load the simulated results when it opens.</p>
        <p>When you run a simulation and then click <b>Yes</b> to view the results in Output Viewer, it launches the program and displays the data gathered during simulation. The first view in Output Viewer is a predefined set of five charts called the Scoreboard report. </p>

        <h2>Scoreboard</h2>
        <p>When your simulation ends, and you choose to view the statistics, Output Viewer
 launches with a Scoreboard report view by default. The Scoreboard report contains 
 charts that display the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1"><strong class="strong_1">Entity State Chart</strong> 
 &#160;&#160;Shows a stacked bar chart of the entities in the model and 
 the percentage of time they spent in different states.</li>
            <li class="li_1"><strong class="strong_1">Scoreboard</strong> 
 &#160;&#160;Provides key statistics for the entities in your model.</li>
            <li class="li_1"><strong class="strong_1">Resource State 
 Chart</strong> &#160;&#160;Shows a stacked bar chart of the resources 
 in the model and the percentage of time they spent in different states.</li>
            <li class="li_1"><strong class="strong_1">Activity State 
 Charts</strong> &#160;&#160;Two charts show stacked bar charts of the 
 activities (single and multi-capacity) in the model and the percentage 
 of time they spent in different states.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are not limited to the reports and charts displayed in the Scoreboard report, 
 and may open others while in Output Viewer. </p>
