        <h1>Process Simulator User Interface Elements</h1>
        <p>With Visio open you will see two areas that are Process Simulator specific. There is also a right-click context menu that is not immediately visible:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1"><b>Process Simulator Stencil</b> Contains many shapes that you can use in your layout. The Process Simulator stencil does not need to remain open to use Process Simulator; you may use shapes from any stencil in your diagram. For more information, see <a href="Process_Simulator_Stencil.htm" target="" title="" alt="" class="a_11">Process Simulator Stencil</a>.</li>
            <li class="li_1"><b>Process Simulator Ribbon</b> Has many tools needed for building and running Process Simulator models. For more information, see <a href="ProcessSimulatorRibbon.htm" target="" title="" alt="" class="a_11">Process Simulator Ribbon</a>.</li>
            <li class="li_1"><b>Right-Click Menus</b> Right-clicking on a shape or connection will show a context menu where you make changes to the shape or connection's properties. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="RightClickMenus.htm" target="" title="" alt="" class="text_page_in_parenthesis">Right-Click Menus</MadCap:xref>.</li>
