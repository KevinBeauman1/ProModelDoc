        <h1>Modeling Activities</h1>
        <p>Activities are the processing steps that are performed on entities as they flow through the system. To model an activity you often need to specify the activity time, the resource(s) that are used, the type of activity (assembly, disassembly, etc.), and any special logic that should get executed. Activity complexity increases when there is a combination of times, resources, actions and logic that occur for the activity. Here we describe the fundamental techniques used to model basic processing activities. Modeling more complex activities is achieved by simply combining these fundamental techniques.</p>
