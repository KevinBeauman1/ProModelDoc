            <MadCap:keyword term="simulation" />Simulation</h1>
        <p>Simulation is the act of running your model through Process Simulator's 
 simulation engine. During simulation, your entities flow through your 
 process according to their routings. Numerical values are also assigned 
 to your statistical distributions. You may simulate your model at any time 
 during its development to troubleshoot problems and verify that it is 
 being developed properly. 

</p>
        <h2>Before you Simulate</h2>
        <p>Prior to Simulation you should define <MadCap:xref href="SimulationOptions.htm" target="" title="" alt="" class="text_page_in_parenthesis">Simulation Options</MadCap:xref>, and have placed at least one entity, arrival connection, 
 and activity on the Visio layout.</p>
        <h2>Starting the Simulation</h2>
        <p>You may start the simulation by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1">Selecting Simulate from the Process Simulator ribbon.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Right-clicking on a blank portion of the Visio layout 
 and choosing Simulate from the context menu.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Opening the Scenario Manager from the Process 
 Simulator ribbon, and selecting Run Scenarios. (Note: this will 
 begin simulating the scenarios marked for simulation in the Scenario Manager.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As the simulation begins, your process will be compiled and translated. 
 During this time, the model will be checked for errors and common mistakes. 
 If errors are found, you will be notified and you 
 will have to correct the issues before simulation is possible.</p>
        <h2>Simulation Ribbon During Run-time</h2>
        <p>Once compilation and translation of the process into a simulation model is complete, 
 the layout view will change to reflect the run-time environment. During 
 simulation you will have several <MadCap:xref href="RunTimeOptions.htm" target="" title="" alt="" class="text_page_in_parenthesis">Run-Time Options</MadCap:xref>.   </p>
        <h2>Completion of the Simulation</h2>
        <p>Upon completion of the simulation, you will be prompted whether you 
 would like to view simulation results. Click <b>Yes</b> to open the Output Viewer. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="ViewingOutputResults.htm" target="" title="" alt="" class="text_page_in_parenthesis">Viewing Output Results</MadCap:xref>.</p>
