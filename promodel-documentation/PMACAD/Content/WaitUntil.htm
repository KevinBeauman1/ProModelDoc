        <h2>Syntax samples</h2>
        <p>Wait Until &lt;Boolean expression&gt; </p>
        <p>Wait Until Var1 &gt; 3<br />Wait Until Var1 &lt; Attr3 And Var2 &gt;= 5</p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Delays processing of the current logic until the Boolean expression is true. The rest of the model continues to process during the delay.  Note that if the expression is initially evaluated to be false, it is only reevaluated when a location attribute, variable, or array element in the expression changes.  Multiple entities waiting on the same condition are released one at a time.  This allows a released entity to change a variable value that will prevent the other waiting entities from being released.  </p>
        <h2>Valid In</h2>
        <p>Activity and route logic. Activated Subroutines. See <MadCap:xref class="Heading_And_Page" href="Subroutines.htm">Subroutines</MadCap:xref> and the <a href="activate.htm" class="a_11">Activate</a> statement.</p>
        <h2>Components</h2>
        <p><b>&lt;Boolean expression&gt;</b>
        </p>
        <p>The condition that must be satisfied to continue processing the entity or resource. Elements of this expression are limited to location attributes, variables, and array elements.</p>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>
            The following example uses the Wait Until statement to batch a variable number of people at an airport shuttle stop.  As each person arrives at LT_Stop (the long-term parking lot shuttle stop), a variable (Total) is incremented to keep track of the number of people waiting at the location.  The Wait Until statement causes all people to wait at this point until the variable, Total, is equal to or greater than five.  Then all of those people waiting are batched together and taken to the long-term parking lot.
        </p>
        <p class="p_11">Inc Total<br />Wait Until Total &gt;= 5<br />Group Total<br />Total = 0</p>
