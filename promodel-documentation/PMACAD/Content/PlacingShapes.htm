        <h1>Placing Shapes</h1>
        <MadCap:keyword term="shapes:placing" />
        <p class="p">Drag entity 
 and activity shapes from the stencil to the page layout to build your process flow. These shapes represent the types of entities being processed and the 
 activities through which they are processed. You will find basic entity and activity 
 shapes on the Process Simulator stencil (the shape type is 
 shown in parentheses below the default shape name, if any), but any other 
 stencil may also be used. </p>
        <p>Not all shapes need to be process related. Some shapes may be placed 
 on the layout for appearance only.</p>
        <p>Change the <MadCap:xref href="Shapes.htm">Shapes</MadCap:xref> type (entity, activity, buffer, storage, resource or plain 
 graphic)  by right-clicking on the shape and selecting the 
 desired type from the context menu.</p>
        <p>By default, if you add a shape from a stencil to the layout, and the 
 shape does not already have a defined type, it will automatically become an 
 activity. However, if you hold the CTRL key while dragging and dropping 
 a shape from any stencil onto the layout, it will become a plain graphic.</p>
