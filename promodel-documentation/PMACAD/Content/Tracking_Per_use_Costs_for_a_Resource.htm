        <h3>Tracking Per-use Costs for a Resource</h3>
        <p class="p">Increase the unit cost of an entity by some constant value each time a particular resource is used.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">The model used for this example, as well as all of the modeling "how-to" examples,  can be found in the ProModel Solutions Café (<a href="http://www.promodel.com/solutionscafe/howto/">http://www.promodel.com/solutionscafe/howto/)</a>.</p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <ol>
            <li class="li_1">Open the resource dialog.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Enter a cost per use for the resource.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Each time during the simulation when this resource is used, the cost per use of the resource will be added to the unit cost of the entity.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Example</h5>
        <p class="p">A dental X-ray machine is used at a dentist office that has a fixed charge of $50 per use. We want to add this cost to the patient cost.</p>

        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/trackingperusesolution1.png" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 5in; }" />
        </p>
        <p class="p">The cost per use for the X-ray machine is set to $50. Alternatively, we could have defined the X-ray as an activity and entered IncCost (Entity, 50) to increment the entity cost by $50.</p>
