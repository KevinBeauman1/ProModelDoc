        <p class="p">Process Simulator utilizes the powerful capability of Data Graphics 
 and External Data linking in Microsoft Visio  2010 Professional and Premium. 
 &#160;When linked 
 to simulated scenario results, Data Graphics provide a more visually interactive 
 means to model analysis and optimization. Resource utilization, activity 
 bottlenecks, entity cost and throughput are all examples of the types 
 of data that can be displayed on shapes using Data Graphics in Process 
 Simulator. &#160;Seeing 
 these results directly on their associated shapes enables you to quickly 
 determine what is happening in your model and where modifications could 
 be made.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">Process Simulator makes it simple for you by automatically creating 
 the external data links to your simulated output results. &#160;It 
 then automatically associates that data with the respective shapes in 
 the diagram. &#160;Applying 
 Data Graphics to the shapes is all you have to do. &#160;Process 
 Simulator has several predefined Data Graphics that can be used or you 
 can create and customize your own.</p>
