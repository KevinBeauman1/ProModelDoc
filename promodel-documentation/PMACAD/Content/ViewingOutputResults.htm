        <p>Once your process has been defined, and then simulated, you are ready 
 to begin making important decisions about your real-world process based 
 on your simulation’s data. To help you make the most of the data collected 
 during simulation, Process Simulator comes with the powerful, easy-to-use 
 Output Viewer. The Output viewer allows you to view 
 your data numerically, in spreadsheet format, or graphically in a variety 
 of charts. </p>
        <p>When your simulation completes, you will be prompted to view the output 
 statistics. If you choose to view the statistics, Output Viewer will 
 launch and display a scoreboard of some of the results. If you wish to view additional charts 
 and reports you may do so while in Output Viewer. &#160;For 
 more information on Output Viewer, launch the help system from within 
 the program.</p>
        <p>Output results are stored in an .rdb file, which has the same name 
 as your Visio document (e.g. MyDrawing.rdb) and is saved
 in the same directory as your Visio document.</p>
