        <h3>Attribute-Based Activities</h3>
        <p class="p">The activity time or other activity action is based on the value of a particular attribute. (For routings based on activity attributes see <a href="ConditionalRoutings.htm">Conditional Routings</a>.)</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">The model used for this example, as well as all of the modeling "how-to" examples,  can be found in the ProModel Solutions Café (<a href="http://www.promodel.com/solutionscafe/howto/">http://www.promodel.com/solutionscafe/howto/)</a>. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxt95EDhNZg&amp;list=UUjdNEjUGmpb-U5ifC2eBJEg&amp;index=21&amp;feature=plcp" target="_blank">A video demonstrating this solution can be found here.</a></p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <ol>
            <li class="li_1">Define at least one entity attribute and make sure it gets assigned a value somewhere in the model (see Working with Variables and Attributes).</li>
            <li class="li_1">Click on the Logic button in the activity Properties dialog.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Define an IF statement to test for the attribute value.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Define a WAIT statement with the desired time for the attribute value being tested.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Example</h5>
        <p class="p">Moldings entering an Inspect and Clean operation are either defective or non-defective. The activity time for defective molds is normally distributed with a mean of 2 minutes and a standard deviation of .5 minutes. Non-defective molds have a mean activity time of .6 minutes with a std. dev. of .2 minutes.</p>

        <ol>
            <li class="li_1">Define an attribute and make sure it gets assigned a value prior to entering the activity where it is going to be evaluated (see Working with Variables and Attributes)</li>
            <li class="li_1">In Logic for the Inspect and Clean operation shows that an IF statement has been defined which checks whether the attribute value called aDefective_Molds is equal to 1 (1=defective).</li>
            <li class="li_1">If true, a WAIT time of N(2, .5) minutes is defined.</li>
            <li class="li_1">An ELSE statement is defined for molds that are non-defective (i.e., aDefective_Molds = 0)</li>
            <li class="li_1">For this case a WAIT time is defined for N(.6, .2) minutes.</li>
