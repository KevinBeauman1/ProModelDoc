        <p>The number of the following resource to free. A value of zero is ignored and values less than zero result in an error. This quantity may be any numeric expression and is evaluated and truncated to an integer every time the Free statement is encountered.</p>
        <p> <b>&lt;resource&gt;</b></p>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>
            In the following example, Cars arrive at Garage for a multi-step process that requires the use of two resources, Mechanic and Assistant.  The first step requires the simultaneous use of both the Mechanic and the Assistant for a normally distributed amount of time.  The Mechanic is then freed while the Assistant performs the second step of the process according to a Lognormal distribution.
