        <p><b>Name</b> This is the simulation-friendly name of the activity and should be used when referenced in logic. It is synched with the text of the activity shape in the layout. It replaces any special characters or spaces with underscores _. This name and the shape text can be unsynched through the option in the Advanced section.</p>
        <p><strong class="strong_1">Capacity</strong> The maximum number of entities (or entity batches) that can be processed concurrently at this activity.</p>
        <p><strong class="strong_1">Buffers</strong> The maximum number of entities that can be waiting in the Input and Output buffer prior to this activity. Enter 0 if there is no input or output buffer. If the capacity is greater than 0, entities routing to the activity will route to the input buffer first. </p>
        <p><strong class="strong_1">Time</strong>The time required to perform the activity. Time units can be specified to be seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks.	Leaving this field blank will result in no wait time during simulation. However, if you create a scenario parameter using this field, the <b>Time</b> value will be changed to 0.</p>
        <p><strong class="strong_1">Multi Entity</strong> The multi entity tab allows you to define different process times and 
 resource requirements for different entity types. </p>

        </p>
        <p><strong class="strong_1">Before Activity</strong> Batching options cause entities to be either grouped into a single entity or ungrouped into multiple entities in the input buffer. This determines whether entities entering the activity are processed individually or as a group.</p>

        </ul>
        <p><strong class="strong_1">After Activity</strong> Batching options cause entities to be either grouped into a single entity or ungrouped into multiple entities in the output buffer of the activity. This determines whether entities route to the next activity individually or as a group.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><strong class="strong_1">None</strong> &#160;&#160;No batching of entities occurs in the output buffer of the activity. </li>

		<h2><a name="Setup"></a>Setup</h2><p>Setup is used to model situations where an activity can process different types of entities, but needs setup or changeover time to do so. The setup time is used only when an entity routes to the activity and is different from the previous entity that was at the activity.</p><p>Setups can only be defined for single capacity activities.</p><p><img src="Resources/Images/ActivitySetup.png" class="img_2" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #1e90ff;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #1e90ff;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #1e90ff;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #1e90ff;" /></p><p><strong class="strong_1">Entity</strong> The name of the entity that will trigger the setup time when it routes to the activity. The keyword “ALL” will incur a setup time for every change of entity type to route to the activity.</p><p><strong class="strong_1">Time</strong> The amount of time the activity will take to setup for the entity. When this time is complete, then processing on the entity will commence.</p><p><strong class="strong_1">Resource</strong> Optionally, select a resource required to perform the setup.</p><p><strong class="strong_1">Priority</strong> If you have chosen a resource to perform the setup, you may also choose a priority to capture the resource. When the entity enters the activity, the activity will attempt to get the resource for the setup using this priority. If the priority is set to Interrupt, the resource will be preempted from the work it is performing to perform the setup at this activity.</p><p><strong class="strong_1">Disable</strong> &#160;Check this box to disable the setup during simulation. This is useful for ignoring the setup without deleting it from the list.</p><h2><a name="Downtimes"></a>Downtimes</h2><p>
			Downtimes are used to model interruptions in the processing of entities at activities. Downtimes may represent scheduled interruptions such as shifts, breaks, or scheduled maintenance. Or, they may represent unscheduled, random interruptions such as equipment failures. Usage based downtimes can only be defined for single capacity activities. The amount of time the activity is down and the timing for going down are defined in this section.

The time spent in a scheduled downtime will be deducted from the total scheduled hours reported in the output statistics and, therefore, will not be considered in computing utilization, percent down, and so on.</li><li class="li_1" value="2"><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Unscheduled:</span> Unscheduled downtimes are not planned for and will appear as such in the output statistics.</li><li class="li_1" value="3"><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Usage:</span> Usage downtimes are used to model downtimes that occur after being in use for a certain amount of time, such as if a machine fails due to wear after so many hours of operation. Usage downtimes are different from scheduled and unscheduled downtimes because usage downtimes are based on operation time, which does not include blocked time. Scheduled and unscheduled downtimes are based on total elapsed simulation time (operation time, blocked time, idle time).</li></ul><p><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Frequency</span>&#160;The clock time (usage time for usage downtimes) between the start of successive downtime occurrences. This option may be an expression. This field is evaluated as the simulation progresses, so the time between downtimes can vary.</p><p><strong class="strong_1">First Time</strong>&#160;The time of the first downtime occurrence. If this field is left blank, the first clock downtime will occur according to the time in the frequency field.</p><p><strong class="strong_1">Interruptive</strong> If this box is checked, any processing at the activity will be immediately put on hold for the duration of the downtime. If unchecked, the downtime will begin as soon as any in-progress processing at the activity is completed.</p><p><strong class="strong_1">Time</strong>&#160;The duration of the downtime.</p><p><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Resource</span> Optionally, select a resource required by the activity for the downtime.</p><p><strong class="strong_1">Priority</strong>&#160;If you have chosen a resource to use for the downtime, you may also choose a priority for capturing the resource. When the downtime occurs at the activity, it will attempt to get the resource using this priority. If the priority is set to Interrupt, the resource will be preempted from the work it is performing to perform the downtime at this activity.</p><p><strong class="strong_1">Disable</strong>&#160;Check this box to disable the downtime during simulation. This is useful for ignoring the downtime without deleting it from the list.</p><h2><a name="Notes"></a>Notes</h2><p>Enter any notes you would like to make in regards to the activity. </p><h2><a name="Advanced"></a>Advanced</h2><p><img src="Resources/Images/ActivityAdvanced.png" class="img_2" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #1e90ff;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #1e90ff;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #1e90ff;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #1e90ff;" /></p><p><strong class="strong_1">Statistics</strong> Check this box to collect statistics for the activity. </p><p><b>Sync Name</b> When checked, the shape text and simulation-friendly Name (in General section) are connected and can only be changed by editing the shape text in the layout. When unchecked, they are disconnected, which allows you to have more descriptive shape text while keeping the simulation-friendly name (used in logic) more simple and concise. </p><p><b>Show Text</b> Checking this option shows the shape text in the layout, while unchecking this option hides the shape text.</p><p><strong class="strong_1">Use Submodel</strong>&#160;This option is used in conjunction with <a href="HierarchicalModeling.htm" class="a_11">hierarchical modeling</a>.
