        <p>Pattern type arrivals allow you to define your arrivals based upon a custom pattern where varying quantities 
 of entities arrive within specified time buckets, similar to a histogram.</p>

        <p><b>Entity</b>&#160;&#160;Shows the entity connected to the arrival connector and specifies the type of entities that will arrive. If an entity is not connected to the arrival connection, then this field will be enabled and the arrival entity is manually selected.&#160;

        <h2>How to define a pattern arrival</h2>
        <p>First, choose the arrival basis, <b>Weekly Time</b> or <b>Calendar Date</b>, by which you will define your pattern arrivals.</p>
        <p>Next, click the <b>Add</b> button to add a pattern arrival record to the grid.</p>
        <p> If 
 the Pattern Arrival basis is set to Weekly Time, enter the <b>Week</b> number and week <b>Day</b>. If 
 the basis is set to Calendar Date, enter the specific <b>Date</b>. The <b>Start</b> and <b>End</b> times define the duration over 
 which the quantity of entities will be randomly distributed. Each row 
 in the grid defines a unique duration and quantity, and all rows together define 
 a custom pattern for the arriving entities. &#160;A 
 pattern arrival is most commonly used to model the arrival of people into 
 a system like patients into a health clinic or customers arriving into 
 a bank. &#160;</p>
        <p>If you use a Pattern arrival in your model, your simulation run length 
 must be defined by either Weekly Time or Calendar Date, but not Time Only. 
 The start time for each row must also be the same or later than the end 
 time of the previous row. See <a href="SimulationOptions.htm" target="" title="" alt="" class="a_11">Simulation Options</a> for more information.</p>
        <h2>Additional options for the pattern arrival</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Quantity Variability</b> When toggled on, the quantities are 
 entered into a Poisson distribution during simulation and thus given  variability for the number of arriving entities. When toggled off, no variability 
 is applied and the exact quantities specified are used. </li>
            <li><b>Repeat Every</b> &#160;Allows you to 
 choose whether or not to repeat the pattern defined and the frequency 
 with which to repeat it. (Note: Repeat interval must be greater than or 
 equal to the total pattern duration.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Values for this grid can be copied  and pasted to and from Microsoft Excel by right-clicking on a cell and selecting from the context menu. To copy data from the grid you must first select the desired cells to copy. &#160;Once the desired cells are selected, right-click and select <b>Copy</b> from the context menu or use the Ctrl+C hot key to copy the data to the Windows clipboard. &#160;The data can now be pasted into Excel. </p>
        <p>When pasting data from Excel into the <b>Pattern Arrivals</b> grid, right-click and select <b>Paste</b> from the menu or use the Ctrl+V hot key to 
 paste the data into the grid.</p>
