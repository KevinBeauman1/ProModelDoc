            <MadCap:keyword term="debug" />Debugging Process Simulator Logic</h1>
        <p>The Debugger is a convenient and efficient way to test or follow the 
 processing of any logic defined in your model. The debugger is used to 
 step through logic one statement at a time and examine variables and attributes 
 while a model is running. </p>
        <p>Before discussing the details of the Debug option, it is important to 
 understand the following terms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Statement</span> 
 &#160;&#160;A 
 statement causes Process Simulator to take some action or perform some 
 operation. This includes statements such as Free, Order, and Wait. </li>
            <li><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Logic</span> 
 &#160;&#160;Logic 
 refers to the complete set of statements defined for a particular process.</li>
            <li><b>Thread</b> &#160;&#160;A 
 thread is a specific execution of any logic. A thread is initiated whenever 
 a logic needs to be executed. Note that the same logic may be running 
 in several threads at the same time. For example, three entities of the 
 same type being processed simultaneously at the same multi-entity activity 
 would constitute three threads.</li>
            <li>A thread or logic execution can be suspended 
 by any statement, causing simulation time to pass (e.g. Wait 5, etc.). 
 After such a statement completes its task, the thread is resumed. During 
 the time a thread is suspended, other threads may be initiated, suspended, 
 resumed, or completed. This is called thread switching.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p_10">Please note: Even though several threads can execute the same logic at the same time 
 in the simulation, the simulation processor can only process them one 
 at a time. So there is really only one current thread while all other 
 threads are suspended (either scheduled for some future simulation time, 
 or waiting to be executed at the same simulation time). </p>
        <h2>Debugger Dialog Box</h2>
        <p>The Debugger dialog is only available at run time, and can be opened 
 during the simulation by clicking on the Debug button in the ribbon. 
 It will also open automatically if the simulation logic encounters a <a href="debug.htm" class="a_11">Debug</a>
 statement. </p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Error Display 
 Box</b> &#160;&#160;Displays 
 the error message or reason why the <b>Debugger</b> dialog box is displayed, 
 such as the User-Condition becoming true.</p>
        <p><b>Context Box</b> &#160;Displays 
 the module, operation, and line number (in which the debugger stopped) 
 where the current logic is being executed from. This can show multiple levels of context, for example, activity logic that calls a subroutine.</p>
        <p><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Logic Display 
 Box</span> &#160;&#160;Displays 
 the statements of the current logic being executed.</p>
        <p><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Local Info Box</span> 
 &#160;Displays 
 local variables and entity attributes with non-zero values (any with zeros are hidden).</p>
        <p><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Run</span> &#160;&#160;Continues 
 to run the simulation, but still checks the debugger options selected 
 in the <b>Debugger Options</b> dialog box.</p>
        <p><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Next Statement</span> 
 &#160;&#160;Jumps 
 to the next statement in the current thread. If the last statement executed 
 suspends the thread, another thread meeting the debugger conditions may 
 be displayed as the next statement.</p>
        <p><b>Into Subroutine</b> &#160;&#160;Steps 
 to the first statement in the next subroutine executed by this thread. 
 Again, if the last statement executed suspends the thread, another thread 
 meeting debugger conditions may be displayed first. </p>
        <p><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Options</span> 
 &#160;&#160;Brings 
 up the <b>Debugger Options</b> dialog box.</p>
        <p><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">End Simulation</span> 
 &#160;&#160;Choose 
 this option to terminate the simulation. This will prompt you about collecting 
 statistics.</p>
        <h2>Debugger Options Dialog </h2>
        <p>The <b>Debugger Options</b> dialog allows the user to specify when to display 
 the Debugger dialog box during the simulation run.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            <img src="Resources/Images/Debuggeroptions.png" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #1e90ff;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #1e90ff;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #1e90ff;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #1e90ff;" />
        </p>
        <p><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Disable debugger</span> 
 &#160;&#160;Disables 
 the debugger completely. By default the debugger is enabled. Running the 
 model with the debugger disabled increases the run speed. When running 
 multiple replications or scenarios, or when the animation is disabled, 
 the debugger will automatically be disabled.</p>
        <p><b>Debug Statement</b> 
 &#160;&#160;Displays 
 the Debugger dialog every time a Debug statement is encountered in 
 logic while running the simulation. </p>
        <p><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Global Change</span> 
 &#160;&#160;Displays 
 the Debugger dialog  every time a global change occurs to a specified 
 variable or array. The Debugger dialog  shows the original and new 
 value of the element. Only one global name can be specified in this field. 
 </p>
        <p><b>User Condition</b> &#160;Displays 
 the Debugger dialog when a defined user condition written as a Boolean 
 expression becomes true, for example, when Var1=5. Only one expression 
 can be specified in this field, although several conditions can be tested 
 by using the OR operator.</p>
        <p><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">Check Condition</span> 
 &#160;&#160;Allows 
 the user to define how often to check the user condition. The options 
 include:</p>
        <ul type="circle" class="ul_4">
            <li class="li_1"><b>Before each 
 statement</b> &#160;The 
 condition, such as Var1 = 1, will be checked before each statement is executed. 
 This option is the most precise way to tell exactly when the user condition 
 becomes true, but it slows down the simulation the most. </li>
            <li class="li_1"><b>At each thread 
 switch</b> &#160;The 
 condition, such as Var3 &gt; 17, will be checked only if a statement from 
 a different thread follows the current statement being executed. </li>
            <li class="li_1"><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">At each thread 
 initiation</span> &#160;The 
 condition, such as Att1 = 5, will be checked only if the next statement 
 to be executed is the first statement in a thread (the first statement 
 in a thread is also the first statement of a logic). </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="c_Override_1" style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span> &#160;&#160;Closes 
 the <b>Debugger Options</b> dialog and continues to run the simulation model.</p>
