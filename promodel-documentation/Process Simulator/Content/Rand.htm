            <MadCap:keyword term="functions:rand;rand" />Function</h5>
        <h2>Syntax samples</h2>
        <p>Rand(&lt;expression&gt;)</p>
        <p>Rand(10) min<br />Order Rand(10) EntA To Act1<br />If Rand(100) &gt; 45 Then aPart = 1</p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Returns a random value n between 0 and X (0 &lt;= n &lt; X) where X is the result of the expression. </p>
        <p>To generate random numbers between the expression and a number other than zero use the expression as the range between the maximum and minimum values. Then add the minimum to the random number. For example, the statement Attr1 = 2+Rand(3) generates a random number from two up to, but not including, five. An alternate method is to use a uniform distribution. Note that the Rand() function works very similar to a uniform distribution. For more information on Distributions, see <MadCap:xref class="lowercase_no_see" href="Distributions.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Distributions</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>This function returns a real number, although the real value may be converted to an integer. To have the Rand() function generate random integer values between zero and some upper bound, use the formula, Integer_Value = Rand(X+1), where X is the greatest integer that should be returned by the function.  For example, to generate a random integer value between zero and six, use the formula, Integer_Value = Rand(7).  The Rand(7) part of this formula will actually generate a real value between 0 and 6.999, but will be truncated to a whole number between 0 and 6 when assigned to an integer value.  Therefore, when generating integer values, make sure that the result of the Rand() function is assigned to an integer value, or is used in an expression where it will be truncated to an integer.</p>
        <h2>Valid In</h2>
        <p>Any logic. </p>
        <h2>Components</h2>
        <p><b>&lt;expression&gt;</b>

        <p>The upper limit of the random value to return.  This value will never be returned.</p>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>
            Two resources, Oper1 and Oper2, perform the same task at an activity, Press. Oper1 works at several other activities. As a result, Press only uses Oper1 30% of the time. The other 70% of the time, Oper2 performs the task.
