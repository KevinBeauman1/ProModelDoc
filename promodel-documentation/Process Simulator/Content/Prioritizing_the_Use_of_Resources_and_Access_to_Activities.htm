        <h2>Prioritizing the Use of Resources and Access to Activities</h2>
        <p class="p">A priority can be specified for acquiring a resource or activity so that, if two or more entities or tasks are waiting for a resource or activity that is currently busy, you can control which entity or task will have first access to it. If no priority is specified, the longest waiting entity gets first access.</p>
