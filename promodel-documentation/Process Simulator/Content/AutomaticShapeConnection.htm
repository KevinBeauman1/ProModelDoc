        <MadCap:keyword term="automatic shape connection" />
        <p>To automatically connect entities and activities as they are placed 
 on the layout, leave the <b>Connector</b> tool selected when dragging them onto 
 the layout. This causes a connector to be automatically drawn from the 
 previously placed shape to the new shape.</p>
        <p>If the connection was not wanted or it is connecting the wrong shape, 
 it is easy to either delete it (press the <b>delete</b> key) or reconnect it 
 to another shape. Make sure you de-select the <b>Connector</b> tool when moving 
 shapes around or when dragging numerous resources or plain graphics onto 
 the layout that don’t require connections.</p>
