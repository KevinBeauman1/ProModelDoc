        <h1>Terminating a Process</h1>
        <p>There are two ways to terminate a process or designate an activity as 
 the last one in an activity sequence.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Simply do not define a routing from an 
 activity. If an activity has one or more routing connections coming into 
 it but none going out from it, it is considered to be a terminating activity 
 and entities simply exit the system after completing the activity.</li>
            <li>An alternative and more visual way to represent a 
 terminating activity is to define a routing from the activity that terminates to 
 anywhere on  the layout (i.e. it does not connect to any 
 other activity). A label called “Exit” will display on the route. 
 During simulation, two statistics will be displayed at the end of the connection; one showing the number of exits 
 that have occurred from that exit routing and the other showing 
 the average cycle time of those exits.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p_2">

        </p>
        <p>The exit and average cycle time statistics
 are also available for analysis in Output 
 Viewer. The statistics are collected as variables. For example, Total Exits is a variable named "vTotalExits_&lt;activity 
 name&gt;_&lt;number&gt;. &#160;The &lt;number&gt; is simply added in case more than one route to exit for 
 the activity is defined. &#160;Any text 
 added to the connection would be included in the variable name and replace 
 the &lt;number&gt;. For example, if Activity 1 had a route to exit with 
 the text "Reject" added to the connection, the variable name 
 would be vTotalExits_Activity_1_Reject.</p>
