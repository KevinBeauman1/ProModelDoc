        <p>Shifts and time off for activities and resources 
 are defined using the Calendar Editor. The interface consists of a <b>Main Menu</b> 
 button, <b>Quick Access</b> toolbar, as well as the <b>Calendar tab</b> and <b>Shifts tab</b>, 
 and the tab-specific toolbars. Clicking between the Calendar and Shifts 
 tabs will display different views of functionality for defining your calendar 
 schedule. Below is a screen shot of the Calendar Editor with the Calendar 
 tab selected.

        </p>
        <p>Time off 
 for holidays and vacation is defined in the <b>Calendar</b> tab by simply selecting 
 the specific days to take off. &#160;A 
 change in which shift an activity or resource is on can also be defined 
 in the <b>Calendar</b> tab. &#160;The 
 details of a shift, which include what hours of each day the shift runs 
 and when breaks occur, is defined in the <b>Shifts</b> tab. &#160;Shifts 
 and breaks may start and end at any 5 minute interval of the day and are 
 defined by selecting blocks in the grid divided into days and hours. Once 
 a calendar schedule has been defined, it may be saved as a calendar file 
 with a .pmcal extension so that it can be selected for use by other activities 
 and resources.</p>
