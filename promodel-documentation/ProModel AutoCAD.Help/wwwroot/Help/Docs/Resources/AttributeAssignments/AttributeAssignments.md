### _Attribute Assignments_
<span style="font-size:14px">

The Resources section of ProModel AutoCAD Edition (PMACAD) allows you to define all the resources shared across your portfolio of projects 
required to perform work on tasks. Users may add resources at any time as projects are created. 
However, the user cannot assign a resource to a project until the resource is first defined. You can also 
define general resource characteristics and assign attributes and contours to a resource.
