Within an organization there may be different groups of users who would like to use the same instance of ProModel AutoCAD Edition (PMAD), 
but with unique and separate data. PMAD now supports ‘Divisions’, which represent individual sets of project data 
within the same instance of PMAD. Users can be granted access to multiple Divisions as needed, and switch between 
Divisions while using PMAD.  

Users with access to multiple Divisions may navigate to another Division via the Division drop-down located at 
the top right of the PMAD toolbar.

### _**Change Division**_

**1.** After logging into PMAD, the current **Division** displays in the top-right corner of the PMAD toolbar.
