# **Simulation Results**
***
<span style="font-size:15px">
<br>

A large part of making the most out of your ProModel AutoCAD® Edition software is knowing how to interpret the results of your simulation. 
This section will include an introduction about the different ways that simulation results are presented, as well as the tools that are available to you for editing and saving your simulation results. 
For more detailed information about how to use Output Viewer, select the **Help** icon in the upper right corner to open a detailed help guide. 

To access your simulation results after running a simulation, select **Yes** when prompted by the window that appears at the end of a simulation. 

<br>

<br>
<br>

You may also select the **Output Viewer** icon in the ProModel ribbon to see the results from your most recent simulation. 

<br>

<img src="Output_Viewer_Icon.png" alt="Output Viewer Icon">

<br>
<br>

If you hover over the **Output Viewer** icon, you will see a description of the tool as well as the command **PMOutputViewer**. 
Typing this command into the command box is another way to open your most recent simulation results. 

When **Output Viewer** first opens, it will display a pre-made report with a selection of results. 
The following section will describe what a report is and what tools you can use to edit your reports. 
Information about particular charts and tables will be included [later in this guide](/pmacad/help/topic?page=Help/Docs/SimulationResults/Simulation_Results.md#Charts_and_Tables).  

<br>

## Reports
<br>

As you first open **Output Viewer** to view your simulation results, a report will be created for you named **Report1**.

<br>

<img src="Report1_Highlight.png" alt="Report 1">

<br>
<br>

A report is a collection of tables and charts that you can create to display your desired simulation results. 
You may edit the initial report that is created for you or create new reports to display your desired information.  

To add a new report, press the “**+**” button located above the report, table or chart that is currently displayed. 

<br>

<img src="Add_Report.png" alt="Add Report">

<br>
<br>

To rename a report, double-click on the report’s name to open a new window. 
Type in your desired report name and select **OK** or press **Enter** on your keyboard to confirm. 
You may also select **Cancel** to exit out of the naming process. 

To remove a table or chart from a report, select the “**x**” button in the corner of any table or chart. 

<br>

<br>

<img src="Table_Right_Click.png" alt="Right-Click Table Menu">

<br>
<br>

If a table or chart displays the message “**No data available for the options selected in the filter**” it either means that the necessary components for that table or chart do not exist in the model, or that they have been deselected in the **Output Viewer Filter**.

<br>

<img src="Table_No_Data.png" alt="Table With No Data">

<br>
<br>

The **Output Viewer Filter** is located to the left of the report, table or chart that is currently being displayed.  

<br>

<img src="Output_Viewer_Filter.png" alt="Output Viewer Filter">

<br>
<br>

The Filter is used to determine what types of information and what items from your model are included in a table or chart. 
Click on a table or chart in a report to view it’s Filter information. 
The Filter is also available when you are viewing a table or chart individually. 

The **Output Viewer Filter** includes a collection of sections that varies based on what type of table or chart you have selected. 
Click on a section to expand it and display the information within the section.

<br>

<img src="Filter_Sections.png" alt="Output Viewer Filter Sections">

<br>
<br>

Each section includes a list of model items, options for a table or chart, or statistical settings that you may click to select or deselect to add or remove the item from your table or chart. 
The exception is the **Options** section, which will contain different drop-down menus of options depending on what type of table or chart you have selected.

Use the **Sort** button to the right of a section name to sort the items within a section based on the selectable options.  

<br>

## Charts and Tables
<br>

This section contains an overview of the most commonly used types of tables and charts. 
For a more extensive explanation of the tables and charts available in **Output Viewer**, see the [Output Viewer Help Guide](https://www.promodel.com/onlinehelp/outputviewer/51/).

<br>

#### Summaries
<br>

Summary tables and charts give a basic summary of useful information for your Locations, Entities, Resources and Variables. 
Summary tables display a collection of numbers to convey a collection of information, while summary charts use bar graphs to visually display a single piece of information at a time. 
Use the **Output Viewer Filter** to change what information is displayed in a summary table or chart.

<br>

<img src="Location_Summary_Table.png" alt="Location Summary Table">

<br>
<br>

<img src="Location_Summary_Chart.png" alt="Location Summary Chart">

<br>
<br>

#### States
<br>

State tables and charts give percentage values for how much time an Entity, Location or Resource spent in each state. 
Entities, Locations and Resources each have a different collection of states that are observed. 
For more information on which actions are included in each state, see the [Output Viewer Help Guide](https://www.promodel.com/onlinehelp/outputviewer/51/). 

State tables display a collection of numerical percentages to convey state information. 
State column charts use bar graphs to visually display information for a single state at a time. 
The charts in the **State** section allow you to view a visual representation of all of the state percentages at once. 
Use the **Output Viewer Filter** to change what information is displayed in a state table or chart. 

<br>

<br>
<br>

<img src="Location_States_Pie.png" alt="Location States Pie Chart">

<br>
<br>

#### Costs
<br>

Cost tables and charts display cost information about your Locations, Entities and Resources, including total costs, operation costs, and usage costs. 
Cost tables display a collection of numbers to convey cost information. 
Cost charts use bar graphs to visually display cost information of a single category at a time. 
Use the **Output Viewer Filter** to change what information is displayed in a cost table or chart. 
 
<br>

<img src="Entity_Costs_Table.png" alt="Entity Costs Table">

<br>
<br>

<img src="Entity_Costs_Chart.png" alt="Entity Costs Chart">

<br>
<br>

#### Utilization 
<br>

Utilization charts demonstrate in a percentage how much a particular Location or Resource was utilized during a simulation. 
More specifically, the Location Utilization chart shows the percentage of the overall scheduled time that the capacity of a location was utilized during the simulation. 
The Resource utilization chart shows the percentage of time each resource was used during the simulation. 
Use the **Output Viewer Filter** to change which items are included in a Location or Resource utilization chart.

<br>

<br>
<br>

<img src="Resource_Utilization.png" alt="Resource Utilization">

<br>
<br>

#### Time Series
<br>

The **Time Series** section includes charts that demonstrate time related information. 

The Time Plot chart uses a line graph to demonstrate different types of information over time such as contents, duration and Variable history. 

The Histogram chart displays the percentage of time that data fell within a particular range of values. 

<br>

<img src="Time_plot.png" alt="Time Plot">

<br>
<br>
