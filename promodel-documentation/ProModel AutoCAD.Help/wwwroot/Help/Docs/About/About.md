In 1988, Charles Harrell founded ProModel, a company that would use predictive analysis to help customers better understand and improve their business processes. 
Today, ProModel has offices in Utah, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and many countries outside of the United States. 
We strive to use our growing resources to help our customers get the information they need to make better decisions, faster.

### _**About ProModel AutoCAD® Edition**_
<br>

The two components of ProModel AutoCAD® Edition are the simulation properties of ProModel and the drawing capabilities of AutoCAD®. 

ProModel is a Windows-based simulation tool for simulating and analyzing production systems of all types and sizes. 
ProModel provides engineers and managers the opportunity to test new ideas for system design before committing the time and resources necessary to build or alter the actual system. 
ProModel focuses on issues such as resource utilization, production capacity, productivity, and inventory levels. 
By modeling the important elements of a production system such as resource utilization, system capacity, and production schedules, you can experiment with different operating strategies and designs to achieve the best results.

AutoCAD® is a computer aided design software (CAD) used to create 2D and 3D drawings. It is utilized by architects, engineers and other professionals to create and visualize their work in a 2D or 3D environment. 
AutoCAD® also offers tools to automate tasks such as comparing drawings, counting, adding blocks, and creating schedules.

ProModel AutoCAD® Edition combines the capabilities of ProModel and AutoCAD® to create a powerful plug-in for both AutoCAD® Architecture and AutoCAD® Mechanical (2019, 2020 and 2021) that allows you to give your CAD drawing (DWG file) ProModel simulation properties.

The ProModel AutoCAD® Plug-in provides a ribbon tab in AutoCAD® that gives you access to ProModel tools, allowing you to access and build your model within your DWG file, create simulations, run scenarios, view the result for easy analysis, and open your model in ProModel AutoCAD® Edition.
