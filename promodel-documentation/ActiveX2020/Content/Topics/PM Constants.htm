        <h2 style="font-family: 'Segoe UI';">PM Constants</h2>
        <p class="p" style="font-family: 'Segoe UI';">You may have noticed that the first parameter in the “SelectMainRecordByName” method used in the code sample in the Syntax section contains a number.  This number references the Locations table.  Because it can be difficult to remember the number codes associated with so many tables, fields, status codes, etc. we have developed text values that you may use in place of the numbers.  To use the pre-defined constants, simply include the PMConstants.bas in one of your program modules (PMConstants.bas can be found in the PowerTools directory where your ProModel application was installed).  Whether you use the pre-defined constants, your own constants or the numbers in your code makes no difference to ProModel.  You can even use constants and numbers in the same method call.  See the Appendix: Table Definitions for a complete list of pre-defined constants, their values and descriptions.</p>
