        <p class="p">Time plots show performance values as they occur over time. This allows you to see trends and spikes in activity as the simulation progresses. Time plots can only be displayed, if the user has selected Time Series as the statistics type for elements in the model. The Time Plot: Bearing Que Contents example shown, shows the contents of the Bearing Que from 5 hours to 15 hours. The green line shows the contents when there is one operator. The yellow line illustrates how the queue contents are less when there are three operators.</p>
