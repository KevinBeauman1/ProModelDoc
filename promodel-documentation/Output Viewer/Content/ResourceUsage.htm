        <p class="p">The Resource Usage time series chart shows how much a resource or resources were used during the course of a simulation. The "Pool by" filter option allows you to view resources individually, pool by resource type so that all the units of a resource are displayed as one item, or pool by scenario so that all resources from a scenario are displayed as one item.   The Capacity Line allows you to compare the actual usage against the maximum potential usage for the resource or resources. The Capacity Line will only change if shifts are assigned or if there are scheduled downtimes. </p>
