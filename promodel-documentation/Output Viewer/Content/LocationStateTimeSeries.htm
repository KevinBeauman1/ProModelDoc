When viewing multiple replications, a 100% stacked column Gantt chart is displayed. If viewing as an individual replication, the Gantt chart shows the exact time when the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-PCS Conditionals.PM">location</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-PCS Conditionals.PCS">activity</MadCap:conditionalText> changed state and how long it remained in that state. In the multiple replication view, each state is totaled within the time intervals, averaged across replications, and then displayed as a 100% stacked column chart in each interval. The timeline can be panned and zoomed using your mouse scroll wheel.Double-clicking in the chart area will reset the view to show the entire simulation timeline. </p>
