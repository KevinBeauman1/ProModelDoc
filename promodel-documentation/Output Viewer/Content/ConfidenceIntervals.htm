        <h1>Confidence Intervals</h1>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">Depending on the degree of precision required in the output, it may be desirable to determine a confidence interval for the output. A confidence interval is a range within which we can have a certain level of confidence that the true mean falls. For a given confidence level or probability, say .90 or 90%, a confidence interval for the average utilization of a resource might be determined to be between 75.5 and 80.8%. We would then be able to say that there is a .90 probability that the true mean utilization of the modeled resource (not of the actual resource) lies between 75.5 and 80.8%.</p>
        <p class="p">Fortunately, ProModel provides convenient facilities for conducting experiments, running multiple replications and automatically calculating confidence intervals. The modeler must still decide, however, what types of experimentation are appropriate. &#160;</p>
