        <p class="p"><b>Units:</b>	The number of units defined in the Resources <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-PCS Conditionals.PM">module</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-PCS Conditionals.PCS">properties</MadCap:conditionalText> for that resource.</p>
        <p class="p"><b>Schedule Time</b>	 The total amount of time the resource was scheduled to be available. (Excludes off-shift time, break time, and scheduled downtimes.)</p>
        <p class="p"><b>Work Time:</b>	The total amount of time the resource was in use.</p>
        <p class="p"><b>Number Times Used:</b>	The total number of times the resource was acquired to transport or process an entity or to service <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-PCS Conditionals.PM">locations</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-PCS Conditionals.PCS">activities</MadCap:conditionalText> or other downed resources.</p>
