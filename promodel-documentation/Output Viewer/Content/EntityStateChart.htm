        <p class="p"><b>% In Move Logic:</b>	 The percentage of time the entity was moving from one <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-PCS Conditionals.PM">location</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-PCS Conditionals.PCS">activity</MadCap:conditionalText> to another during the simulation, including any delay time incurred in move logic, and including any time waiting for a resource to become available when that resource is requested in the move logic.</p>
        <p class="p"><b>% Waiting:</b>	 The percentage of time the entity was waiting for a resource, another entity or a wait until condition in order to begin processing or move to the next <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-PCS Conditionals.PM">location</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PM-PCS Conditionals.PCS">activity</MadCap:conditionalText>.
