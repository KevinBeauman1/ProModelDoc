        <p class="p">All of the scenarios with simulated output for a given model are listed. If data sources from other models have been added, their scenarios will also be added to this list (see Adding Data Sources for more information). The first scenario listed (Baseline) is selected by default when creating a new chart in a Report View. Check the box next to those scenarios you would like to appear in the chart. Uncheck those scenarios that you would like to remove from the chart.</p>
