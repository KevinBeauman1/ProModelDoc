        <h1>Importing from 3DS Max into 3D Animator</h1>
        <p class="p">3DS Max is part of Autodesk collection/s and is freely available to the use with the collection subscriptions. Inventor IPT files can be opened with in 3DS&#160;Max and and converted to .X files that can be used within 3D Animator using CGDEV Plug-in.</p>
        <h4>3DS Max Conversions Using Plugin</h4>
        <p>1.	Navigate to: http://www.cgdev.net/axe/download.php.</p>
        <p>2.	Click on the link to download the proper version.  Axe_free_max2020_x64.zip.</p>
        <p>3.	Extract the downloaded file from the .zip into the following directory: C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max [YOURVERSION}\plugins</p>
        <p>4.	Run 3DS Max.</p>
        <p>5.	Import an Inventor asset (.ipt file). Please note, that if you customized the asset’s properties in Inventor, a new .ipt file will have been automatically created with those changes, and you should open that new file.</p>
        <p>6.	During import, you will be prompted with options.  ‘Inventor File Vertical Direction’ may need to be changed if the 3D object is not oriented vertically.</p>
        <p>7.	Select the Export &gt; Export… option.</p>
        <p>8.	From the Select File to Export dialog, change the ‘Save as type’ to Alin DirectX Exporter Free.</p>
        <p>9.	When exporting, you will be prompted with options.  The most pertinent ones are:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>a.	Z-Rot: This is typically 270, but may require a change if you did not orient your asset when importing, see step 6.</p>
            <p>b.	Right-handed: This should be checked in most cases, but if your asset is inverted in 3D Animator, this may need to be unchecked.</p>
            <p>c.	Scale: The asset may need to be scaled to match other 3D objects. This can be done here during export, or left as ‘1’, and scaled later in 3D Animator.</p>
