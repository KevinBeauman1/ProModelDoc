            <MadCap:keyword term="3D Layout" />3D Layout Navigation Tab</h2>
        <p class="p">Selecting the 3D Layout navigation tab will display the 3D view, where you can see the objects in the model before animation, and watch them interact during animation.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">Whether you are using features in the 3D layout prior to animation or during animation, understanding how to navigate the 3D layout is the first step to using the 3D view.</p>
