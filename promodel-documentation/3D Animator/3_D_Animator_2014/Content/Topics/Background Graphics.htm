        <p class="p">
            <img src="BackgroundGraphicsCat.bmp" />The Background Graphics category shows a list of the optional background graphics in the animation. Unlike the first five category options, you may add or delete background graphic records in the list. </p>
        <p class="p">Double click on the name cell of the asterisk row to add a new background graphic</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Name:</b> The name of the background graphic.</li>
            <li><b>Graphic File:</b> The name and/or location of the graphic file for the background graphic. This may simply be the name of the graphic file of the type .x, or it may contain a fully qualified path to the location on your computer of the graphic file.<br />If left as simply a name, 3D Animator will look for the graphic file in your default graphic directory, as specified in the Options dialog, or in the same directory as the .sup file.</li>
            <li><b>Locked:</b> When checked, locks the graphic in the 3D Layout so that it may not be accidentally moved.</li>
            <li><b>Position X/Y/Z:</b> Sets the graphic’s location on the 3D layout measured in layout units. For a description of layout units and their relation to the floor grid, see <MadCap:xref href="Layout Category.htm#C-04_1942222156_1076683" target="" title="" alt="" class="lowercase_no_see">Layout Category on page 1</MadCap:xref>. </li>
            <li><b>Scale X/Y/Z:</b> Changes the size of the graphic as a fraction of the default size. For example, .5 in this field will shrink the graphic by 50%, and 2 will double the graphic’s size.<br />By changing just one or two of the axes, the graphic will stretch. Changing all three axes will uniformly shrink or grow the graphic.</li>
            <li><b>Rotation X/Y/Z:</b> Rotates the graphic’s orientation along the desired axis. Leaving this field blank will not change the graphic’s orientation, which means the graphic will face the direction it was created in.</li>
        </ul>
