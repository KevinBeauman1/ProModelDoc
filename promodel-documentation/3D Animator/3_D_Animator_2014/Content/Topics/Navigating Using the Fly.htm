        <h4>Navigating Using the <MadCap:keyword term="Fly-Through" />Fly-Through Technique</h4>
        <p class="p">The fly-through technique is a simple way to move the camera as if it were free floating through the layout.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">To do so click and hold the right mouse button over the layout, and use the E, S, D, and F keys on the keyboard to move the camera.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">The E and D keys will move the camera forward and backward, while the S and F keys will pan the camera laterally. Moving the mouse while holding the right mouse button will rotate the camera.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">This keyboard and mouse combination allows you to fly the camera through the layout.</p>
