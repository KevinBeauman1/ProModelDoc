        <p class="p">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Walk-Through Mode" /><b>Walk-Through Mode:</b> Places and locks the camera at head height, which gives a walk through perspective. Zooming, rotating, or changing views and perspectives will exit the Walk-Through mode.</p>
        <p class="p"><b>Perspective/Parallel Projection:</b> Choose one of these options to toggle between a perspective or parallel projection.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Perspective Projection" /><b>Perspective Projection:</b> This option shows the 3D perspective view in the 3D layout. In this view you may pan, rotate, and zoom the 3D layout in any direction.</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Parallel Projection" /><b>Parallel Projection:</b> This option emulates a top-down 2D view of the 3D layout. When in this view, you may pan and zoom the layout, but you may not change the rotation away from the top-down perspective that emulates the 2D view in the 3D layout.<br />If you would like to view a top-down 3D view, there is a factory-set “Top View” in the Views menu.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p"><b>Lock Selected Object:</b> When an object is selected in the 3D layout, this option will be available. If you choose to lock the selected object, you will not be able to move it in the layout. This is useful to avoid accidentally moving the wrong objects.</p>
        <p class="p">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Show Grid" /><b>Show Grid:</b> Toggles the grid lines on the floor of the layout on and off.</p>
        <p class="p">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Show Floor" /><b>Show Floor:</b> Toggles the layout floor on and off.</p>
        <p class="p">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Show Floor Direction" /><b>Show Floor Direction:</b> Toggles the three colored lines on the layout, which denote the axes on the floor, on and off.</p>
        <p class="p">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Show Paths" /><b>Show Paths:</b> Toggles whether network paths are visible on the layout.</p>
        <p class="p">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Show Graphic Objects" /><b>Show Graphic Objects:</b> During animation, there may be objects that are waiting to enter the layout, for example, entities. The graphics for these objects can be shown prior to entering the layout during animation. Use this option to show or hide these graphics, which appear in the corner of the layout by the Floor Direction line.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">This option can also be used to see the direction your entities and dynamic resources will face when auto-orienting. Auto-orienting means the object will change its rotation along the z-axis as it moves through the layout, for example, a dynamic resource will auto-orient as it moves along a path, so that it always appears to face forward.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">The part of the object graphic that faces the negative y-axis in this view will be the part of the object that will face forward during auto-orientation. Therefore, if you wish a resource or entity to face forward while auto-orientating, be sure it is rotated to face the negative y-axis while shown in this area.</p>
        <p class="p">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Refresh Layout" /><b>Refresh Layout:</b> Redraws the layout.</p>
