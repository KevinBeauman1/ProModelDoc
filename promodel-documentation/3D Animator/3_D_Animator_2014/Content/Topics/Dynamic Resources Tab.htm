        <p class="p">
            <img src="ResourceDynViewTab.gif" />The Dynamic Resource view shows a list of the animation’s dynamic resource graphics in the left pane. Clicking on a resource name in the left pane will display detailed graphic information about that resource in the right pane.</p>
        <p class="Graphic">

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Name:</b> A list of names for each dynamic resource in the animation. Click on a name to view graphic information for that resource in the right pane.</li>
            <li><b>Graphic File:</b> The graphic file for the resource. If there were multiple icons for the resource in the model, each one will appear in this list, so that you may assign individual graphics.</li>
            <li><b>Scale X/Y/Z:</b> Changes the size of the resource graphic as a fraction of the default size. For example, .5 in this field will shrink the graphic by 50%, and 2 will double the graphic’s size.<br />By changing just one or two of the axes, the graphic will stretch. Changing all three axes will uniformly shrink or grow the graphic.</li>
            <li><b>Rotation X/Y/Z:</b> Rotates the resource graphic’s orientation along the desired axis. Leaving this field blank will not change the graphic’s orientation, which means the graphic will face the direction it was created in.<br />While the resource is auto-orienting, meaning it will automatically rotate to face forward as it moves through the layout, this rotation value will determine what is “forward facing.”<br />To see if the resource is facing forward, view its graphic before starting the animation. The graphic will be outside the floor, near the floor direction indicators, and the “Show Graphic Objects” option must be enabled.<br />The part of the resource graphic facing the negative y-axis will be the “front”, and face forward during auto-orientation.</li>
            <li><b>Pin X/Y/Z:</b> Sets the position where the resource graphic is pinned to the path.<br />Use the Graphic Viewer to see where pins are positioned in relation to your object. See <MadCap:xref class="lowercase_no_see" href="Graphic Viewer.htm#C-03_1948710220_1078360">Graphic Viewer on page 1</MadCap:xref> for more information.</li>
            <li><b>Entity Spot X/Y/Z:</b> The position of the entity spot on the resource graphic. This will determine where entity graphics appear when they have captured a resource.<br />Use the Graphic Viewer to see where entity spots are positioned in relation to your object. See <MadCap:xref class="lowercase_no_see" href="Graphic Viewer.htm#C-03_1948710220_1078360">Graphic Viewer on page 1</MadCap:xref> for more information.</li>
