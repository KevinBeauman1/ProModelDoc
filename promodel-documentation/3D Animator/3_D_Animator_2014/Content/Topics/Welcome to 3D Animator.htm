        <h1><a name="C-01_1953035596_1050207"></a>Welcome to 3D Animator</h1>
        <p class="p">ProModel 3D Animator is a post-simulation add-in for ProModel products (ProModel, MedModel, and ServiceModel). Using a 3D animation script generated by your ProModel product, you may now view any simulation in a fully-configurable, 3-Dimensional layout.</p>
        <p class="p">Major advantages of 3D Animator over ProModel product’s traditional 2D animation are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li_1">All objects, including the layout, are now rendered three-dimensionally, allowing the animation to closely reflect the reality that your model is simulating.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Objects automatically orient themselves on paths and conveyors to face the direction of travel.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Instead of being limited to only a top view, you can now view the animation from any angle.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Animations can be choreographed to automatically pan, zoom, change animation speed, and track objects as they move during animation.</li>
            <li class="li_1">Since 3D Animator runs post-simulation, the animation is no longer tied to the running simulation. The animation can be sent to others and viewed without requiring them to run the simulation.</li>
        </ul>
