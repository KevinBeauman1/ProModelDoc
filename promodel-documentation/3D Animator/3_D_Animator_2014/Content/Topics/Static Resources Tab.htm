        <h4>Static Resources Tab</h4>
        <p class="p">
            <img src="ResourceStaticViewTab.gif" />The Static Resource view shows a list of the static resource graphics in the animation.</p>
        <p class="Graphic">
            <img src="ResourceStaticTable.gif" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Name:</b> The name of the resource.	</li>
            <li><b>Graphic File:</b> The name and/or location of the resource graphic file for the graphic. This may simply be the name of the graphic file of the type .x, or it may contain a fully qualified path to the location on your computer of the graphic file.<br />If left as simply a name, 3D Animator will look for the graphic file in your default graphic directory, as specified in the Options dialog, or in the same directory as the .sup file.</li>
            <li><b>Locked:</b> When checked, locks the graphic in the 3D Layout so that it may not be accidentally moved.</li>
            <li><b>Position X/Y/Z:</b> Sets the resource graphic’s location on the 3D layout measured in layout units. For a description of layout units and their relation to the floor grid, see <MadCap:xref href="Layout Category.htm#C-04_1942222156_1076683" target="" title="" alt="" class="lowercase_no_see">Layout Category on page 1</MadCap:xref>. </li>
            <li><b>Scale X/Y/Z:</b> Changes the size of the resource graphic as a fraction of the default size. For example, .5 in this field will shrink the graphic by 50%, and 2 will double the graphic’s size.<br />By changing just one or two of the axes, the graphic will stretch. Changing all three axes will uniformly shrink or grow the graphic.</li>
            <li><b>Rotation X/Y/Z:</b> Rotates the resource graphic’s orientation along the desired axis. Leaving this field blank will not change the graphic’s orientation, which means the graphic will face the direction it was created in.</li>
        </ul>
