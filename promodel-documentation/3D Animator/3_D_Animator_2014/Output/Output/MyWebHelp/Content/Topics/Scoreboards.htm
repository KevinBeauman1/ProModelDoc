        <p class="p">
            <img src="ScoreboardCat.png" />The Scoreboards category allows you to choose which global variables from your model you would like displayed in the layout.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">Multiple scoreboards may be defined and then toggled on or off during animation.</p>
        <p class="Graphic">
            <img src="ScoreboardTable.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="p">The Scoreboard category area is divided into three areas:</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Scoreboard List:</b> The top area of the Scoreboard category shows a list of the available scoreboards that may be displayed during animation. You may add new scoreboards to the list by double clicking on the Name cell of the asterisk row.<br />Clicking on a scoreboard name will show its selected and available variables in the two areas below the scoreboard list.</li>
            <li value="2"><b>Scoreboard Details:</b> The lower-left area of the Scoreboard category shows a list of variables that will be displayed for the highlighted scoreboard in the scoreboard list.<br />Each record row in this area will equal a new line in the scoreboard that is displayed during animation.<br />The order of these variables can be changed by highlighting a row and then clicking and dragging it to the desired location.<br />Double clicking on the Name cell of the asterisk row in this area will add a new text-type entry to the scoreboard with the text entered as the name. This text will remain static during animation, and is useful for creating headings and organizing the variables listed in the scoreboard.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p_10">Please Note</p>
        <p class="p_10" style="font-style: italic;">Text-type scoreboard entries cannot be moved from the Selected Variables area to the Variable Repository area. Text-type entries belong only to the scoreboard they were created in, and are deleted if moved.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Variable Repository:</b> The lower-right area of the Scoreboard category shows a repository of the variables available for addition to a scoreboard.<br />By default, this list will be empty. Since each variable can only be included in one scoreboard, the default scoreboard will contain all the variables in its selected variables list. To free variables from the default scoreboard, which will add them to the variable repository area, see “Adding/Removing Variables from Scoreboards” below.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Adding/Removing Variables from <a name="kanchor107"></a>Scoreboards</h4>
        <p class="p">To add a variable to a scoreboard from the repository, or return a variable to the repository, select a variable from one of the lists:</p>
        <p class="Graphic">
            <img src="ScoreboardAddVariable.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="p">Then you may either press the <b>Delete</b> button on the keyboard, or click the arrow in the divider between the two lists, to move the variable.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">The variable will then appear in the other list.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">Text-type entries will be deleted if moved, since they are specific to the scoreboard they were created in.</p>
        <h4>Displaying a <a name="kanchor108"></a>Scoreboard During Animation</h4>
        <p class="p">Once your scoreboards have been defined, you may choose to display them during animation by checking the Visible box in the scoreboard table, or by selecting them from the Animation menu or the 3D layout Right-click menu.</p>
        <p class="Graphic">
            <img src="ScoreboardDisplaying.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="p">If a scoreboard has a check mark by its name, it will be displayed during animation.</p>
        <h4>Column Definitions for the <a name="kanchor109"></a>Scoreboard Table</h4>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Name:</b> The name of the scoreboard. Selecting a name in this list will display that scoreboard’s list of variables in the area below.<br />The scoreboard names will appear in the available scoreboard list for the Animation menu and the 3D layout right-click menu.</li>
            <li value="2"><b>Board Color:</b> The background color of the scoreboard.</li>
            <li value="3"><b>Text Color:</b> The color of the scoreboard’s text and numbers.</li>
            <li value="4"><b>Opacity:</b> The transparency level of the scoreboard.</li>
            <li value="5"><b>Digits:</b> The maximum number of digits that will appear for variable values on the left side of the decimal.</li>
            <li value="6"><b>Decimals:</b> The maximum number of digits that will appear for variable values on the right side of the decimal.</li>
            <li value="7"><b>X/Y Position:</b> Sets the position for the scoreboard on top of the 3D layout. Since scoreboards are not objects in the 3D layout, but instead are an overlay, this X/Y position is not relational to the X/Y axes of the 3D layout, and is instead measured from the top-left of the layout window. <br />Additionally, scoreboards will not move when the camera moves.</li>
            <li value="8"><b>Visible:</b> Toggles the scoreboard on and off in the 3D layout.</li>
        </ul>
