        <p class="p">
            <img src="EntityCat.bmp" />The entities category lists all of the animation’s entities in the left pane. Clicking on a name in the left pane will show specific information about that entity’s graphic or graphics.</p>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Name:</b> A list of names for each entity in the animation. Click on a name to view graphic information for that entity in the right pane.</li>
            <li><b>Graphic File:</b> The graphic file for the entity. If there were multiple icons for the entity in the model, each one will appear in this list, so that you may assign and customize individual graphics.</li>
            <li><b>Scale X/Y/Z:</b> Changes the size of the entity graphic as a fraction of the default size. For example, .5 in this field will shrink the graphic by 50%, and 2 will double the graphic’s size.</li>
            <li>By changing just one or two of the axes, the graphic will stretch. Changing all three axes will uniformly shrink or grow the graphic.</li>
            <li><b>Rotation X/Y/Z:</b> Rotates the entity graphic’s orientation along the desired axis. Leaving this field blank will not change the graphic’s orientation, which means the graphic will face the direction it was created in.<br />While the entity is auto-orienting, meaning it will automatically rotate to face forward as it moves through the layout, this rotation value will determine what is “forward facing.”<br />To see if the entity is facing forward, view its graphic before starting the animation. The graphic will be outside the floor, near the floor direction indicators, and the “Show Graphic Objects” option must be enabled.<br />The part of the entity graphic facing the negative y-axis will be the “front”, and face forward during auto-orientation.</li>
            <li><b>Pin X/Y/Z:</b> Sets the position where the entity graphic is pinned to paths or location and resource entity spots.<br />Use the Graphic Viewer to see where pins are positioned in relation to your object. See <MadCap:xref class="lowercase_no_see" href="Graphic Viewer.htm#C-03_1948710220_1078360">Graphic Viewer on page 1</MadCap:xref> for more information.</li>
