        <ul>
            <li><b>Name:</b> A list of names for each path network in the animation. Click on a name to view path information for that network in the right pane.</li>
            <li><b>Color:</b> Each network may have its own color. This is useful for visually identifying separate networks in the 3D layout.</li>
            <li><b>Locked:</b> When checked, locks the network in the 3D Layout so that it may not be accidentally moved.</li>
            <li><b>Name (Path Details):</b> Shows a list of the paths in the selected network. The names can be expanded to show each path segment’s points and their positions.</li>
            <li><b>Position X/Y/Z:</b> Sets the location, in layout units, for each joint on the path. For a description of layout units and their relation to the floor grid, see <MadCap:xref href="Layout Category.htm#C-04_1942222156_1076683" target="" title="" alt="" class="lowercase_no_see">Layout Category on page 1</MadCap:xref>. </li>
