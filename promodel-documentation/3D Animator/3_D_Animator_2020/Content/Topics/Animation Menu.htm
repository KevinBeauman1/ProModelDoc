        <p class="p">The Animation menu allows you to start and stop 3D animations, as well as choose animation-specific options.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Play" /><b>Play:</b> Starts the 3D animation. You may start the animation from anywhere in 3D Animator. You do not need to be in the 3D Layout view; however, when the animation starts the view automatically changes to 3D Layout view.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p_10">Please Note</p>
        <p class="p_10" style="font-style: italic;">The hot key for starting an animation is F5, pausing an animation is F6, and stopping an animation is Shift-F5. Remembering to use these hot keys can greatly speed up your use of 3D Animator.</p>

            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Pause" /><b>Pause:</b> Pauses the animation.</li>

            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Display Animation" /><b>Display Animation:</b> Toggles the animation on and off. This is useful for turning off the animation to allow the animation clock to run as fast as possible.

            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Animation Speed" /><b>Animation Speed:</b> Use this slider to speed up or slow down the rate of the animation and its clock.</li>

            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Display Clock" /><b>Display Clock:</b> Toggles the animation clock, which is located in the upper-right corner of the layout, on and off.</li>

For information on defining scoreboards, see <MadCap:xref class="lowercase_no_see" href="Scoreboards.htm#C-04_1942222156_1077066">Scoreboards on page 1</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Track Selected Object" /><b>Track Selected Object:</b> During animation you may click on an object in the layout and choose this option. The camera will then follow that object throughout the layout. <br />The hot key for this option, <i>Ctrl+T</i>, is useful for quickly tracking an object after you have clicked on it. You may use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out while tracking the object.<br />To stop tracking an object you may do the following:<ul><li>Press the <b>ESC</b> key.</li><li>Track a different object.</li><li>Switch to any defined view.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
