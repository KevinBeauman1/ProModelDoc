        <h2>Importing a DirectX file into 3D Animator</h2>
        <p class="p">Once the file has been exported from SketchUp as a DirectX file, you can import or load it into 3D Animator.  It can be used as a Location, Entity, Resource, or Background Graphic. To do so, start 3D Animator and open up an existing setup file (.SUP).  In this example we will replace an Entity graphic in the Deaerco demo model with the one exported from SketchUp.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">From the Objects menu select <b>Entities</b>. Click on the "Customer_Order" entity in the entities list and then select the <b>Browse</b> button next to the “White board.X” graphic file.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">
            <img src="sketchup_importingdirectx1.bmp" />
        </p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">The <b>Open Graphic</b> window will appear.  Click on the <b>Browse</b> button and locate the directory where the .X object was exported to. (In this example we saved the object to the Windows Desktop.)</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">
            <img src="sketchup_importingopengraphic.bmp" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 4in; }" />
        </p>
        <p class="p">Selecting the directory and clicking <b>OK</b> will then show the .X files that exist in that location.  Your exported .X file should show up in the list.  By selecting it you will be given a preview of the object as seen below:</p>
        <p class="p">
            <img src="sketchup_importingopengraphicducati.bmp" />
        </p>
        <p class="p">Choose <b>OK</b> and the object will show up in 3D Animator (in this case, it will replace the entity graphic).</p>
