        <p class="p">Remember that with 3D you will be able to see and do things you were unable to do with 2D animation. Below are some tips to follow when building a model to be animated later in 3D.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">Develop the model as though you are looking at a top or plan view of the layout. This will facilitate the default placement of the 3D graphics.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">2D graphics get replaced by corresponding 3D graphics with the same name so you can plan in advance which 3D graphics get used by synchronizing the graphic names. Of course you can also change whichever 3D graphics get used once the 3D layout is created. </p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">With auto-orientation of entities and resources in 3D you will not need to use GRAPHIC statements in node logic if it is only used to change graphic orientation. On the other hand, if you are depending on auto-orientation for orientating a resource, you may need to add additional path segments to get the resource facing the right direction at a location.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">Don’t spend too much time adding graphic embellishments or background graphics to the model in 2D since you will have to do it over in 3D.</p>
        <p class="p">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p">Don’t spend lots of time lining up variables to create a scoreboard in 2D since 3DA automatically creates a scoreboard in which all variable values are displayed.</p>
