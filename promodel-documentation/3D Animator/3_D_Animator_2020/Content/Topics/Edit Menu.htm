        <p class="p">The Edit menu allows you to manipulate the data and records contained in the grids within the Layout. Using the tools in the Edit menu can greatly accelerate the populating of the grids in 3D Animator, as information that is repeated throughout the file can be copied and pasted to fill in cells in the grids.</p>
